INTRODUCTION TO THE CANADIAN 
FIREARMS SAFETY COURSE 

Overview 

The Canadian Firearms Safety Course (CFSC) is designed to apply to the broadest 
possible spectrum of novice firearm users. Existing firearm safety courses across 
Canada have a proven track record in the reduction of firearm-related incidents. 
However, most of these courses have been designed and delivered for firearms use in a 
specific activity. The CFSC is an introductory firearm safety course intended for all new 
firearms users. 

Individuals who wish to acquire restricted firearms must also pass the Canadian 
Restricted Firearms Safety Course tests. 

The Canadian Firearms Program 

The Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) is administered by the RCMP/CFP, which 

works with provincial Chief Firearms Officers and many community partners across the 
country in implementing the Firearms Act and its Regulations, and other related 
legislation regarding firearms. 

The goal of the Canadian Firearms Program is the safe and responsible use of firearms, 
and it includes a range of activities directed toward achieving that goal such as the 
following: 

•     the licensing of all firearm owners and businesses; 

•     the delivery of the Canadian Firearms Safety Courses; 

•     public education regarding safe storage, transport and use of firearms; and 

•     import and export controls. 

Licensing, registration and other Program information are recorded in the Canadian 
Firearms Information System, a national database that is managed by CFP. Certain 
information is available to law enforcement agencies to help them prevent and 
investigate firearms incidents and crime, consistent with the public safety objectives of 
the Firearms Act.  

Your personal information is carefully protected by the Canadian Firearms Program, 
consistent with the Firearms Act and its Regulations, federal and provincial privacy laws 
and other applicable statutes.  

If you have any questions about the Canadian Firearms Program, please contact us at 
the following location:

You can also consult the Firearms Act and its Regulations directly via the RCMP/CFP 

website. 

The RCMP/CFP wishes you the best in following the Canadian Firearms Safety Course 
for the class of firearm you wish to acquire and/or possess. Please note that all 
Canadian Firearm Safety Course instructors and examiners must be designated by the 
Chief Firearms Officer for the province or territory in which you are taking the course. 

Course Objectives 

Firearm owners have social responsibilities. By completing this course, you will be 
instructed on what these responsibilities are. You will learn how to do the following: 

•     Handle firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Use firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Comply with firearms laws. 

•     Store non-restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Display non-restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Transport non-restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

The Canadian Firearms Safety Course consists of two parts. One is classroom 
instruction. The other is learning the material in this handbook. There will be both written 
and practical examinations. Successfully passing them will demonstrate the knowledge 
and skills you have gained in the course. Live firing exercises, however, are not offered 
as part of this course. 

During the course, some topics are discussed and explored several times. This will help 
you learn and retain the content. Leaving anything out of the course will reduce the 
amount you learn. This applies to all assignments, exercises or examinations given by 
your instructor. 

The course emphasizes safe storage, display, transportation, handling and use of non-
restricted firearms but safety depends on more than just safe physical actions. 
 - 19 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014

Safe handling must include greater knowledge of the firearms themselves, ammunition, 
and the laws and regulations related to them. 

Course Handbook 

Safety also relies on your attitude about responsible handling and use of firearms. Pay 
close attention to the section on legal, ethical and social responsibilities. The safety of 
the people around you depends on it. Your own safety depends on it, also. 

This book is an essential part of the course. The other component is the classroom 
lessons and practical exercises given by the instructor. Together, they will help 

you learn how to safely handle firearms. 

This book contains the following elements: 
•     The Vital Four ACTS of firearm safety 
•     A brief history of firearms 

•     Information on firearms and ammunition and how they work 

•     Instructions on how to pick up, handle and carry non-restricted firearms safely 

•     Descriptions of how to unload, load and fire non-restricted firearms safely 

•     Descriptions of the correct firing positions 

•     Instructions on range safety 

•     Instructions on the care and cleaning of non-restricted firearms 

•     Examples of factors leading to firearm incidents and the misuse of firearms 

•     A summary of ethics and laws affecting firearm owners and users 

•     Information on how to store, display, transport and handle non-restricted firearms 

safely 

•     A glossary of firearm terms 

•     Appendixes 

This is an introductory course. More information and training is available on the various 
shooting sports from their own qualified instructors, associations and local clubs. We 
recommend you contact them directly for further details. 

Do not hesitate to contact provincial/territorial or local authorities for more detailed 
information on firearm laws and regulations in your area.

Consult the Firearms Act and its Regulations or a firearms officer, for information 
on controls affecting firearm and ammunition manufacturers, dealers and museum 
operators. 

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

Your instructor will refer to many different safety rules and guidelines. Time and again, 
the instructor will return to four basic rules. Any time you hear of an incident occurring, 
you can be sure at least one of these rules has been broken. These rules are known as 

the Vital Four ACTS. 

The first letter of each rule becomes a letter in the acronym ACTS. You may want to 
think of these rules as acts you must carry out. 

 

The Vital Four ACTS 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 

•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards yourself or any other 

person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the trigger 
guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger guard when you pick 

up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it safe. 

•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. Do this every time 

you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an essential rule to adopt. 
 - 21 -

PROVE It Safe Pointers 

 

PROVE It Safe 

 

Point the firearm in the safest available 
direction. 

 

Remove all ammunition. 

 

Observe the chamber(s). 

 

Verify the feeding path. 

 

Examine the bore for obstructions (visually or 
with a rod). 

 

The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of the 
person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe.

Legal Responsibilities 

As a firearm owner and user, you have legal as well as social responsibilities. These 
responsibilities are laid out in federal, provincial/territorial and municipal laws and 
regulations. The table below describes a few of the regulations that come from each 
level of government. 

 

Table 1. Some Legal Responsibilities of a Firearms Owner/User 

Government Level                            Example of Law or Regulation 

Federal 

(e.g., Firearms Act and its 
Regulations, Criminal Code) 

•     All firearm owners need a valid firearm licence. 

•     If you are the holder of a valid Firearms Licence, you 

must inform the Canadian Firearms Program within 30 
days, when you change your address. 

•     Persons holding a valid Possession Only Licence (POL) 
may borrow the same class of firearm that he/she is 

licensed to own. Persons holding a valid Possession 
and Acquisition Licence (PAL) may borrow, buy, inherit 
or otherwise acquire the same class of firearm that 
he/she is licensed to own. 

Provincial/Territorial 

(e.g., Game, Fish and Wildlife Acts) 

•     Some provinces/territories may require anyone who 

hunts with a non-restricted firearm to wear blaze 
orange clothing. 

•     Some restrict shooting across or within a certain 

distance of roads or dwellings. 

•     Some provincial/territorial laws may limit your use of 

motorized vehicles while hunting or shooting. 

Municipal/County/Local 
(e.g., Noise, Nuisance, Zoning, By-
laws) 

•     Some municipalities or counties may not allow the 
discharge of a firearm under any circumstances within 

their boundaries. 

•     Some will regulate firing times and/or closeness to 

dwellings. 
 - 23 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

24 

Other duties of firearms owners/users 

a.  A firearm owner/user must also keep informed about the laws and regulations 

affecting the use of firearms and ammunition. 

b.  Going beyond what the regulations require will increase your safety. Some 

suggestions are listed below: 

•     Keep an inventory of your firearms. Also keep any supporting documents 

such as photographs and owner's manuals. Store these documents in a safe 
place. This will help you describe any firearm that may be stolen or lost. It will 
also be easier for you to find your owner's manual and records of service or 

repair. 

•     Keep informed. Changes may occur in laws and regulations from time to time. 

This can happen at any level, whether at the federal, provincial/territorial or 
municipal. 

•     Avoid advertising about the firearms in your home. You may be inviting theft. 

 Every person commits an offence who, without lawful excuse, points a 
firearm at another person, whether the firearm is loaded or unloaded, and is: 

1.    guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 

exceeding five years; or 

2.    guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction (a fine of $5,000 

and/or six months imprisonment). 

 

Reference: Subsections 87(1) and (2) of Part III of the Criminal Code 

 

They may also lose their firearm, lose their licence, receive a fine, receive jail time 
and/or be prohibited from possessing a firearm for a period of time.

MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION TO FIREARMS 

1.1. The evolution of firearms 

1.1.0. Overview 

By all accounts and historical references, it is believed that the Chinese were the first to 
develop explosive powder. They used it in fireworks and rockets. It was also invented at 
about the same time by the English alchemist Roger Bacon (1214-1292). 

1.1.1. Cannon 

a.  People in the Middle Ages quickly learned to use black powder to launch balls or 
projectiles from a cannon. They did this by igniting the powder behind the ball or 
projectile in a cannon (Figure 1). 

b.  The burning powder in the cannon produced rapidly expanding gas which forced 

the ball or projectile out of the open end of the barrel. 

c.   Today, black powder and substitutes are used in different types of firearms and 

for various purposes (e.g., hunting, target shooting).

1.1.2. Matchlocks 

One of the earliest carried firearms was the matchlock (Figure 2). It was invented in the 
early 1400's. The matchlock made it possible for the user to aim and fire while holding 
the firearm with both hands, but rain or wind could put out the match/wick. In addition, 
the presence of incandescent particles near the powder could cause an incident.

1.1.3. Wheel locks 

Two improved firing systems were developed in the 1600s. These were the wheel lock 
(Figure 3) and the flintlock (Figure 4). The wheel lock worked much like a modern 
cigarette lighter. The spring was wound up with a key. The wheel lock mechanisms 
were complex and expensive to make. Also, winding was slow and the spring often 
failed.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014

1.1.4. Flintlocks 

1.  The flintlock (Figure 4) has an ignition mechanism similar to the wheel lock. It 
produced its spark by striking a flint against steel. Since it weighed less and was 

simpler and cheaper to make, it soon became more popular. 

2.  For centuries, flintlocks were the standard firearms (Figure 5). During this time, 

many improvements were introduced. One such improvement of the flintlock over 
the matchlock and wheel lock was the development of a more reliable ignition 
system.

1.1.5. Percussion caps 

The percussion cap (Figure 6) was developed in the early 1800s. It was a small metal 
case (cap) containing material that would explode when struck.

1.1.7. Cartridges 

a.  All early firearms were muzzleloaders. They loaded through the muzzle. But 
muzzleloaders were slow to reload. They were also limited to one shot per barrel. 

b.  Attempts were made to develop firearms that loaded from the back. They were 

called breechloaders. However, these early attempts failed because the 
expanding gases from the burning powder charge leaked back through the 
breech parts. 

c.   In the mid-1800s, various cartridge types were developed that made breech 
loading practical. Eventually, metal-cased cartridges similar to modern ones were 

created (Figure 7). 

d.  These cartridges contained the bullet or shot, the main powder charge and the 

primer, in one package. Pulling the firearm trigger caused the firing pin to strike 
the primer. The flash from the primer ignited the powder charge. The burning 
charge caused the cartridge casing to expand. This sealed the breech to prevent 
gas leakage. The expanding gas launched the projectile down the barrel. 

e.  Cartridges had at least four advantages: 

1.    They were easily loaded into the breech. 

2.    The expanding case prevented gas leakage. 
3.    They were largely weatherproof. 

4.    They were more reliable. 

f.   Cartridges called shells were developed for use in shotguns. These too contain 
one or more projectiles, powder and primer in one container. In addition, a wad 
separates the powder from the projectiles. The cartridge casing may be made 

from metals or other materials such as paper or plastic. 

g.  Metallic cartridges and shotgun shells were easy to manufacture. Loading 

firearms also became simpler. This made repeating firearms practical.

1.2. Firearms in Canada 

Since the 1500s, firearms have played a role in the history and development of 
Canada. They greatly expanded the range and effectiveness for hunting. People 
were willing to trade large quantities of furs for firearms and ammunition. Hunting 
provided a major source of food. It was often critical for survival, especially in poor 
crop years. 

Later, the need for hunting to provide food became less necessary for most people 
for survival. However, many people today still rely on hunting as an important part of 
their lives. 

Many have also turned to target shooting. Today, numerous shooting clubs and 
associations exist. Their members shoot various types of shotguns or rifles. A wide 
range of targets from clay to paper also exists. 

There are also many gun collectors.

Table 3. Types of Black Powder 

Fg              Very coarse granules of powder. Used in larger bore muskets. 

FFg           Finer granules than the Fg. Used in muzzleloading shotguns, big-

bore rifles and single-shot pistols of .45 calibre and up. 

FFFg         Finer granules than the FFg and the most common type. Used in 

nearly all cap and ball revolvers. 

FFFFg       The finest granules, also called priming powder. Used only in the 

priming pans of flintlocks. Never use this type of powder as 
powder charge. 

 

 Because of advancements in technology, some firearms are 
manufactured to handle either smokeless, black powder or black powder 

substitutes. It is emphasized that all individuals follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions regarding powder types and safe loads.

a.  Muzzleloading muskets, rifles and shotguns are still in use today. However, most 

modern muzzleloaders are reproductions of older designs (Figure 8). 

b.  This type of firearm is loaded through the muzzle. A measured amount of powder 

is poured through the muzzle into the barrel, followed by a patch and ball, bullet 
or shot. A hole located at the rear of the barrel just above the trigger allows a 
flash or spark to enter the barrel through the priming port and ignite the powder, 
firing the charge. 

c.   With flintlock muzzleloaders, the igniting spark is the result of the flint, held by the 

cock, hitting the frizzen. On percussion muzzleloaders, the flash is produced by 
the hammer striking a percussion cap. 

d.  Muzzleloading firearms use black powder or black-powder substitutes. Black 
powder is classified as an explosive and is easily ignited by heat, friction, static 

electricity or a sharp blow and must be handled with extreme care. It is strongly 
recommended that individuals interested in muzzleloading seek additional 
training from qualified specialists in the field.

 Older firearms should be inspected by a qualified gunsmith to be sure 
they can be fired safely.

2.2.1. Loading muzzleloaders 

a.  Today, most firearms for black powder use are reproductions of muzzleloaders. 
Older firearms may not be safe to fire and should be checked by a gunsmith 

before use. 

b.  If a muzzleloader is not primed to fire, it is safer to handle. To ensure that a 

muzzleloader is not primed to fire, do the following: 

1.    Point the muzzle in the safest available direction and keep finger off the 

trigger and out of the trigger guard. 

2.    Check that the hammer is not in full-cock position. 

3.    Check for a percussion cap or see if the priming pan is primed. 
4.    If the firearm is primed, remove cap or priming powder. 

c.   In addition, it is difficult to tell if there is already a charge loaded in the barrel of a 
muzzleloader. Experienced shooters mark the firearm's ramrod at a level that 

shows the bore depth when the bore is empty (Figure 9). When the marked 
ramrod is inserted into the barrel, it shows whether or not the firearm is loaded. 

 For other models of muzzleloading firearms, check with the manufacturer 
for specific safety features and information regarding the loading and unloading 
process.

Figure 9. Correctly marked ramrod 

 In the case of muzzleloading firearms that have a safety catch, activate 
the safety catch before loading it. Prior to loading the firearm, use a cleaning rod 

with a fitted patch to check the gun bore and fire cap to ensure that nothing 
obstructs the chamber and gun bore. It is very important that the exact loading 
and unloading procedures are followed when handling muzzleloaders (figures 10 
and 11). Before attempting it, get the assistance of a qualified individual and 
carefully follow the instructions in your owner’s manual.  

CONSULT THE MANUFACTURER’S RECOMMENDATIONS.

 Always use the powder recommended for your muzzleloader. Never use 
smokeless powder in a muzzleloader. Never use black powder in a modern 
cartridge firearm not designed for it. Always use a volumetric measure to put 
powder into the muzzle; never pour directly from the main powder container. 
Under safe-storage regulations, black-powder firearms are considered loaded 
when powder and/or ball are in the barrel. 
 - 42 - 

MODULE 2 

43 

2.2.2 Cleaning a muzzleloader 

a.  ACTS and PROVE. 

b.  A black-powder firearm must be properly cleaned after every firing session. Black 

powder is very corrosive. It attracts moisture, which causes rust. Refer to the 
owner's manual. 

c.   Cleaning black-powder firearms improperly can result in carbon build-up in 

the barrel, which may cause coking (carbon accumulation). This condition may 

cause a glowing ember to remain after firing, resulting in a dangerous situation if 
the firearm is reloaded. 

d.  Use either commercial black-powder cleaning solvent or hot, soapy water. 

e.  You will also need a ramrod with a cleaning patch attached. Use a rod as close 

to the bore diameter as possible.  

f.   Use wet patches to soften the dried powder. 

 

2.2.3. DOs and DON’Ts of muzzleloading 

•     Do have old muzzleloading firearms dismantled, examined and declared safe by 

a qualified gunsmith before using them. 

•     Do handle the muzzleloader with the same respect due all firearms. 

•     Do use ONLY black powder or black-powder substitutes (e.g., Pyrodex) in your 

muzzleloader. 

•     Do keep black powder far away from all cigarettes, matches/wicks or anything 

with an open flame, embers or anything that may cause sparks or heat. 

•     Do always use a powder measure to pour powder directly into the muzzle. Never 

use the powder horn or flask. 

•     Do carefully follow the manufacturer's recommendations for maximum powder 

charge. 

•     Do mark your ramrod to indicate when the barrel is empty and when it is loaded. 

•     Do wipe the bore clean of oil and excess grease before you load. 

•     Do make sure the ball or bullet is seated firmly on the powder charge. 
 - 43 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

44 

•     Do treat a misfire as a hangfire that could fire at any second. Wait at least 60 

seconds with the firearm pointed in a safe direction. 

•     Do wear safety glasses and hearing protection during the firing sequence. 

•     Do reseat your second charge after firing and reloading a single barrel on a 

multiple-barrel black-powder firearm. Recoil can move the charge forward. 

•     Don't carry or handle a muzzleloading firearm with the hammer at full cock and 

primed unless you are ready to fire. 

•     Don't lean over or stand in front of the muzzle at any time. 

•     Don't load one barrel of a double-barrelled-muzzleloading shotgun unless the 

percussion cap on the nipple of the other barrel has been removed. 
•     Don't store a muzzleloader with powder in it. 

Subject to provincial/territorial regulations, loaded muzzleloading firearms may be 
carried from one hunting ground to another if the firing cap or flint is removed. 

 

 Black powder is also used in some metallic cartridges for firearms 
specifically designed for their use. Care should be taken. Although they have the 

same name as a modern-smokeless cartridge, they may not be interchangeable. 
Never interchange smokeless powder and black powder. Use them only in 
firearms intended for their use.

MODULE 3: MAJOR FIREARMS PARTS 

3.1. Major firearms parts 

3.1.0. Overview 

a.  To use a firearm safely, you must know its parts and understand how they work. 

The following is a brief introduction to the parts of a firearm. Their functions are 
explained in more detail in MODULE 6 - OPERATING FIREARM ACTIONS. 

ACTS    Assume every firearm is loaded. 

b.  Modern firearms consist of three major parts: the barrel, the action and the stock 

(figures 12 and 13). 
 - 47 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

48 

 

Figure 12. Bolt-action rifle 

 

Figure 13. Pump-action shotgun 

3.1.1. Barrel 

a.  The barrel is a tube, typically made of metal. The bullet or shot travels down this 

tube when the firearm is fired. 

b.  Often, manufacturers identify cartridge information that is required for that firearm 

on the barrel— this is called the data stamp. 

c.   The opening at the end of the barrel from which the bullet or shot emerges is 

called the muzzle. 

 

ACTS    Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

 
 - 48 - 

MODULE 3 

49 

3.1.2. Action 

The action contains the parts that do the following: 

•     Chamber the cartridge 

•     Fire the ammunition 

•     Ejects the unfired cartridges and fired cartridge/shell casings 
3.1.3 Trigger 

a.  Triggers, safeties and magazines are all parts of the action. 

b.  The trigger releases the hammer or firing pin that fires the cartridge. The trigger 

guard is a rigid loop around the trigger made to protect it and prevent anything 
from unintentionally touching the trigger. 

ACTS      Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and 

out of the trigger guard. 

  

3.1.4. Safeties 

a.  Safeties usually block some part of the action to prevent firing. Some firearms do 

not have safeties. 

b.  The safety should be ON / SAFETY POSITION whenever a firearm is loaded. It 

should only be moved to OFF / FIRING POSITION when required. 
c.   Some safeties may also act as decocking levers. 

 Never rely on the safety to prevent firing. A loaded firearm with the safety 
ON could still fire. All mechanical devices can fail— safeties can wear down and 
may not operate properly. 

3.1.5. Magazine 

a.  The magazine is a device that holds cartridges in repeating firearms. The 
location of the magazine depends on the make and model of the firearm. 

b.  The magazine can be either fixed or removable. 
 - 49 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

50 

3.1.6. Stock 

a.  The stock is the handle of the firearm. Most are made of wood or a synthetic 

material. 

b.  Stocks are designed to automatically align your finger with the trigger when you 

pick up the firearm. You must be ever cautious not to put your finger into the 
trigger guard or on the trigger of a firearm that you are picking up. 

 

ACTS    See that the firearm is unloaded – PROVE it safe. 
3.1.7. PROVE it safe

Point the firearm in the safest available direction. 

 

Remove all ammunition. 

 

Observe the chamber. 

 

Verify the feeding path. 

 

Examine the bore for obstructions. 

 

The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of the 
person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. 
 - 50 - 

MODULE 3 

51 

3.2. The firing sequence 

Almost all modern firearms follow the same firing sequence (Figure 14): 

1.  A squeeze on the trigger releases the firing mechanism. This results in the firing 

pin striking the primer of the cartridge. 

2.  When struck by the firing pin, the primer explodes. This projects a flame into the 

cartridge body. 

3.  The flame from the primer ignites the powder. The powder burns and produces 

rapidly expanding gases. 

4.  The high-pressure gas drives the bullet or shot forward down the barrel. 

 

 

Figure 14. Firing sequence 
 - 51 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

52 

3.3. Action types 

a.  Firearms vary in design, depending on their purpose. Some are made for target 

shooting. Others are used for hunting birds or small game. Still others are for 
hunting big game. 

b.  The two common types of non-restricted firearms (long guns) are as follows: 

•     Shotguns 
•     Rifles 

c.   The basic types of modern actions (Figure 15) used in these firearms are as 

follows:  

•     Muzzleloader (percussion cap and flint) action 
•     Hinge (or break) action 

•     Bolt action 

•     Lever action 

•     Pump action 

•     Semi-automatic action 

d.  Some firearms have several barrels. Typically, these are shotguns or 

combination shotguns/rifles.

3.4. Classification of firearms 

a.  The classification of firearms is as follows: 

•     Non-restricted 
•     Restricted 

•     Prohibited 

b.  Legal requirements for a particular firearm depend on the class to which it 
belongs. Prohibited firearms are subject to the most stringent controls, restricted 

firearms are controlled to a lesser extent and non-restricted firearms are the least 
regulated of the three classes. 

c.   Many air guns, due to their high power, are included in the provisions of the 
Firearms Act and its Regulations. For this reason all air guns must be treated as 

firearms with respect to safe practices, such as the Vital Four ACTS of Firearm 
Safety. 

 The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety and PROVE apply to all classes of 

firearms. 

 

3.5 Legal responsibilities 

 Various laws, regulations and restrictions govern your activities as an 
owner/user of a firearm. They set minimum standards of conduct, and you have 

both a legal and a social responsibility to understand and obey them.

MODULE 4: BASIC FIREARM SAFETY 

4.1. Overview 

Almost all firearm incidents can be prevented by following some basic safety rules. The 
most important of these are the Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety (Table 5) and 
PROVE It Safe (Table 6). You may want to think of these rules as acts you must carry 
out. 

 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 
•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards 

yourself or any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the 
trigger guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger 

guard when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE 

it safe. 

•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. 

Do this every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an 

essential rule to adopt.

4.2. Basic firearm safety practices 

4.2.0. Overview 

While many safety practices have been incorporated into the Firearms Act and its 
Regulations, experienced firearm users often exceed those requirements by following 
some or all of the recommended safety practices listed in the following sections. These 
safety practices are summarized in Table 8 in Module 10.5. (For specific requirements 
on storage and transport, see MODULE 11: SAFE STORAGE, DISPLAY, 
TRANSPORTATION & HANDLING OF NON-RESTRICTED FIREARMS.) 
 - 58 - 

MODULE 4 

59 

4.2.1. Firearms and ammunition safety practices 

Some of the safety practices are listed below: 

•     All firearms and ammunition under your control are your responsibility 24 hours a 

day. 

•     Firearms are safer when stored and transported under lock and key. Examples 

include trigger or cable locks, and securely locked containers. 

•     In many cases, you are required by law to have your firearm unloaded and properly 

locked. Be aware of what the law says about which firearms need to be locked and 
when. 

•     Keep firearms and ammunition out of sight during transport and storage. This will 
reduce the chances of theft. It will also prevent unqualified or unauthorized persons 

from using them. 

•     Ammunition and firearms must be kept away from unsupervised children. Unlawful 

storage of firearms is a criminal offence that can lead to tragedy and serious 
consequences for the person found to be responsible. 

•     Store firearms unloaded. Lock the firearm and the ammunition separately when 
storing them or lock them in a secure container, receptacle or room that cannot be 

easily broken into. 

4.2.2. Load a firearm only for actual use 

Some of the safety practices are listed below: 

•     A firearm should be loaded only when you intend to use it and where it can be safely 

and legally discharged. At all other times, it should be unloaded. 

•     At the firing range, load a firearm only when you have reached the shooting area 

and you are ready to shoot. Completely unload the firearm before you leave the 
shooting area. 

•     Always make sure a firearm is unloaded before you pass it to anyone or anytime it 

leaves your hands. Whenever possible, leave the action open. 

•     Never accept a loaded firearm from anyone. 

•     Never run with a loaded firearm. Never climb or cross an obstacle with a loaded 

firearm. Never jump a ditch with a loaded firearm. 

•     Never toss or drop a firearm across a ditch or fence. 

•     Do not lean loaded firearms against a vehicle, tree or wall. They could fall over and 

discharge. 
 - 59 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

60 

•     Transport only unloaded firearms by vehicle or boat. Many incidents occur as 
firearms are being stored or removed from a vehicle. The motion of the vehicle or 

boat can make you stumble or drop the firearm. Either way, it can fire unintentionally 
if it is loaded. 

•     Always unload a firearm before transport or storage. This prevents unintentional 
discharge if the firearm is bumped during transport. It also reduces the chances of 

unexpected firing by an unqualified user. 
4.2.3. Be sure before you shoot 

Some of the safety practices are listed below: 

 Always use your firearm in the safest manner possible. Be sure of your 
target and beyond before you shoot. 

•     Always examine the bore for obstructions before loading. 

•     Always check that you are using the right ammunition. Use only the 

ammunition for which the firearm was designed. Carry only the type of 
ammunition you intend to shoot. 

•     Never rely on the firearm's safety. Safeties wear down and may not work 
properly. A loaded firearm may fire even with the safety on. All mechanical 

devices can fail. 

4.2.4. Be sure of your target and beyond 

a.  To be sure of your target and beyond, follow the recommendations below: 

•     Positively identify your target. Make sure it is exactly what you want to shoot. 

•     Do not shoot when in doubt. Never fire at a movement, a colour, a sound or a 

shape. 

•     Check that you have a clear field of fire. 

•     Check that the area behind your target is safe before shooting. 

•     Never use a scope as a substitute for binoculars to identify persons, animals 

or objects. 

b.  Always be aware of where your bullet or shot may end up. This is your 

responsibility. A bullet or shot may ricochet. It may also travel far beyond the 
target. If you are unsure, check the following recommendations: 
 - 60 - 

MODULE 4 

61 

•     Never shoot if your bullet may hit a hard surface or water. Both can cause a 

bullet or fragments to ricochet in unsafe directions. 

•     Never shoot at a target near a building. 

•     Never shoot at a target on top of a hill. 

•     Only shoot when you are sure no one is ahead of you. 

4.3. Secure locking devices 

a.  Secure locking devices (Figure 18) prevent a firearm from being fired. To work 
effectively, they must be installed properly. Please note that not all secure locking 

devices are compatible with each firearm. 

b.  In some cases, they are required by law (MODULE 11: SAFE STORAGE, 

DISPLAY, TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING OF NON-RESTRICTED 
FIREARMS). Several devices are available for this purpose. The most common 
are key and combination trigger locks, and chain or cable locks. All of these locks 
block operation. Check with a firearms dealer for a locking device best suited for 
your specific firearm.

MODULE 5: AMMUNITION 

5.0. Overview 

This module discusses rifle cartridges, and shotgun shells. This will help you choose the 
right ammunition. You should only carry ammunition that suits the firearm that you are 
using and the target that you intend to shoot. This applies whether you are hunting or 
target shooting. 

 

For more detailed information, consult a firearms vendor or a gunsmith. 
5.1. Rifling 

a.  Rifled barrels have a series of spiral grooves inside the barrel. The ridges of 
metal between the grooves are called lands. The lands and grooves together 

make up the rifling (Figure 19).  

b.  Rifling makes the bullet spin as it leaves the barrel so that it will be stable in 

flight, thus making the bullet more accurate. 

 

5.2. Calibre 

a.  Rifled firearms are sized by calibre. A calibre is a measurement of bore diameter 

in either thousands of an inch (Imperial) or in millimeters (Metric). Inch 
dimensions are usually measured from land to land, while metric dimensions are 
measured from groove to groove. 

 Always consult the data stamp on the barrel of your firearm to find out 
the exact name of the ammunition that it fits.

5.3. Cartridges 

5.3.0. Overview 

a.  A cartridge is the ammunition used in a rifle or a handgun. Two kinds of 

cartridges commonly available are: rim-fire and centre-fire. These terms describe 

where the primer is located at the base of the cartridge casing. They also 
describe where the firing pin strikes (Figure 18). 

 

Figure 20. Examples of a rim-fire and centre-fire cartridges with head stamp 
b.  Manufacturers produce firearms of many calibres. Always make sure the 

cartridge name on the “head stamp” matches the information on the data 
stamp, if available, on the barrel of the firearm (Figure 20). This is the most 
important point to remember when selecting ammunition. Then, choose the right 
type of ammunition for your firearm and target. The right shape or weight of the 
bullet is an example. If in doubt, consult a firearms or ammunition vendor. 

c.   If there is no data stamp, take the firearm to a qualified individual. They can 

measure the chamber and advise on proper ammunition.

Figure 23. Example of a barrel data stamp 

 Use caution when purchasing used firearms. Some firearms may not have 
a data stamp, or they may have an incorrect stamp. Some firearms may have 

been altered and the existing data stamp may be incorrect. They should be 
checked by a qualified individual before use. 

If you are re-loading your own ammunition, you must strictly follow the 
instructions and procedures outlined in the manuals provided for this process. 
Visually inspect all cartridge components for defects before loading. 

d.  Many firearm owners load their own centre-fire ammunition. This allows them to 
save money and create a high quality product made specifically for their firearm 
and shooting conditions. If you load your own ammunition, you must rigorously 

follow the instructions and procedures indicated in the relating manuals. 

e.  Incorrectly loaded ammunition may cause the firearm to malfunction or jam. 

Malfunctions could lead to an incident. The firearm could explode and injure the 
shooter. Do not accept or use reloaded cartridges unless you know that they 
were made and reloaded correctly.

5.3.1. Cartridge components and materials 

Ammunition varies in size, appearance and materials. Ammunition cartridges for rifles 
are made up of four basic components described below. (Figure 24),  

 

Table 5. Cartridge Components and Materials 

 

 

 

Figure 24. Centre-fire 
bullet, powder charge, 
case, and primer 

1.    The bullet is the projectile at the front end of the 

cartridge. It is propelled from the firearm when the powder 

burns. Usually, the bullet is made of lead, lead alloy or 
other dense material. It may also be covered by a jacket 

of a harder metal. When the nose of the bullet is covered 

in this manner, it may be referred to as a full-metal jacket, 
hard point or ball ammunition. If the lead is exposed at the 
front of the bullet, it is referred to as a jacketed soft point. 
Copper, gilding metal or steel are commonly used as 

jacket material. 

•  Bullets come in a variety of sizes, shapes and weights 

(Figure 25). You must select the right combination for 
the target or the area where you plan to shoot. 

•  Bullets for hunting often have a soft or hollow point. 
They are designed to expand on impact. This uses up 

most of the energy on the target. 

•  Target bullets are often made from lead alloy. 

2.    The powder charge is a chemical compound inside the 

case. It is ignited to propel the bullet through the barrel. 
3.    The case holds all the other ammunition parts. It is 

usually made of brass. It could also be made of steel, 
copper, aluminum, or plastic in the case of shotgun shells. 

4.   The primer works in much the same way as a cap in a 

toy pistol. It contains a chemical mixture that explodes 
when the firing pin strikes it. This explosion ignites the 
powder charge.

5.3.2. Types of cartridges 

There are two basic types of modern cartridges: rim-fire and centre-fire. 

a.  Rim-fire ammunition's priming chemical fills the space inside the bottom rim of a 

thin brass or copper cartridge casing. The soft rim dents when struck by the firing 
pin. This crushes the priming compound. It explodes, and this ignites the powder 
(Figure 21). 

•     Popular modern rim-fire cartridges are .22 calibre or .17HMR. The most 
common is the .22- cartridge. It is available in BB, short, long, and long rifle; 

however, it is not interchangeable with the .22 magnum cartridge. Be sure to 
use the correct ammunition for your specific firearm. 

•     Rim-fire cartridge bullets generally are made of lead. They are lubricated with 

grease or special waxes that reduce the build-up of lead in the rifle barrel. In 
some cases they can be encapsulated in copper that’s a full-metal jacket (i.e., 
.17HMR). 

 Dry firing any firearm can damage the firearm. Dry firing means to initiate 
the firing sequence without a cartridge in the chamber.  

 

b.  Centre-fire ammunition (Figure 22) is used for higher power firearms. The primer 
is located at the centre of the base of the cartridge case. The firing pin strikes the 
primer. This explodes the priming compound. This in turn ignites the powder 

charge. 
 - 71 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

72 

5.3.3. Cartridge names 

a.  There are various ways of identifying or “naming” cartridges. Some cartridges 
have several names. The cartridge name, or an abbreviation of it, is stamped on 

the head of the case. It is also found printed on the ammunition manufacturer’s 
box (Figure 26).  

b.  Historically, cartridge names contained their approximate calibers. Calibre refers 
to the diameter of the bore. Calibre may be measured in thousands of an inch or 
in metric. 

c.   Currently, modern firearms include the length of the cartridge casing in the 
description of the cartridge to identify the name of the ammunition that the 
firearm is designed to use. This is done to tell the difference between cartridges 

having the same calibre but different cartridge casings. For example, cartridges 
with different names are not interchangeable (.303 Savage and .303 British, 
7-mm Mauser and 7-mm Remington Magnum, .300 Savage and .300 Win 

Mag). 

d.  A manufacturer may choose to make a firearm or ammunition in a cartridge 

originally made by another manufacturer, as a result, confusion can occur. For 
example, you can use a Remington rifle to fire a .300 Winchester Magnum 
cartridge made by the Federal Cartridge Company. 

e.  The head stamp includes very valuable information, such as the cartridge name. 

It may also tell you the following: 

•     the calibre 

•     the manufacturer 

•     whether the ammunition is regular or magnum and any other relevant details 

f.   Always read the cartridge name head stamp. It is the only way to be sure that the 
cartridge matches the firearm. If in doubt, check with a gunsmith or gun shop. 

g.  The term magnum comes from the description of a large bottle of wine. It was 
first applied to large bottleneck cartridges that produced greater power than was 

the normal standard for that calibre. Today, it is more a marketing term than a 
technical term, but is an important part of the name. 
 - 72 - 

MODULE 5 

73 

 Some ammunition may not have a cartridge name head stamp such as 
rim-fire cartridges. Also, some privately reloaded ammunition may no longer 
match the original stamp. Whenever possible, refer to the information on the 
ammunition box. If in doubt, have any such ammunition assessed by a qualified 
individual before you use it.

Figure 27. Cut-away of ammunition chambered in a barrel 
5.4. Shotgun barrels 

a.  The use of smooth slugs, rifled slugs, and slugs contained in a sabot or plastic 
sleeve, is becoming more common in modern shotguns (Figure 28). This allows 

shotguns to fire single projectiles (bullets). 

b.  Some shotguns were manufactured with adjustable chokes. Modern shotguns 

are made with interchangeable choke tubes. On these models, the choke can be 
changed simply by unscrewing a removable tube at the muzzle of the barrel and 
replacing it with another tube with a different choke. 

c.   A shotgun with interchangeable chokes or barrels can be used for skeet or clay 
target shooting, migratory waterfowl, upland game birds, and large game hunting, 

depending on the ammunition used and the regulations in the area.  

d.  The rifled barrel is becoming popular. The rifled barrel provides the options of 

using a smooth slug, a rifled slug or a sabot slug. The rifled barrel is designed to 
make the projectiles spin as they leave the muzzle. This makes them more like a 
normal rifle bullet, increasing accuracy and useful distance. 

e.  Rifled shotgun barrels are identical to a normal rifle barrel except that they have 

the bore diameter of the gauge of the shotgun. This has resulted in better 
accuracy and new uses for shotguns.

Figure 28. Types of shotgun slugs 
5.5. Shotgun gauge 

Shotgun barrels are sized by gauge instead of calibre. Gauge is an older system of 
measurement and is calculated by the number of lead balls (each having the same 
diameter as the bore) that weigh one pound. In other words, if it took 12 balls with the 

same diameter as a bore to make one pound, a shotgun with that bore would be called 
a 12-gauge shotgun. One exception to this rule is the .410-cal. shotgun. It is measured 
as a calibre because it was developed later (Figure 29).

MODULE 5 

77 

5.6. Choke 

a.  Except in the case of a rifled barrel, the bore of a shotgun barrel is usually 
smooth and may be narrowed at the muzzle end. This narrowing is called the 

choke. 

b.  The choke of a shotgun barrel helps control the spread of the shot after it is fired. 

This is very much like the way the nozzle of a garden hose controls the spray of 
water. 

c.   The pattern of the pellets on the target is affected by the choke. 

•     Full choke produces a tight pattern. 

•     Modified choke produces a more open pattern. 

•     Improved cylinder produces a more open pattern. 
•     Cylinder bore produces the most open pattern. 

d.  A shotgun barrel which has no choke or narrowing at the end of the barrel is 
called a cylinder bore. It is often used for larger pellet sizes such as buckshot or 

slugs. 

e.  Most modern manufactured shotguns feature a screw-in choke that can be 

changed depending on the use of the shotgun. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

See Figure 30 for the uses of the various chokes and their shot 
patterns. The pattern will depend on the different type of shot used, for 
example; lead, steel, bismuth or tungsten-iron among others. It is the 
shooter’s responsibility to learn about the shotgun pattern and to 
determine the pattern for their particular shotgun and ammunition.

5.7. Shotgun shells 

5.7.0. Overview 

a.  Shotgun ammunition is centre-fire. The casing or hull has a thick, solid base. The 
primer is located in a separate cup in the centre bottom of the casing (Figure 31). 
b.  The firing pin strikes the primer. This explodes the priming compound and ignites 

the powder. The shot charge is usually a number of pellets. It can also be a 
single slug. 

5.7.1. Shotgun shell components and materials 

a.  Shotgun shell components are similar to those of rifle cartridges. However, there 

are five components, not four (Figure 32). The five shotgun components are 
described below. 

1.    Shot is the name for the charge of pellets fired from a shotgun. Shot may be 

either lead, steel, bismuth or tungsten-iron pellets. Historically, shot was 
primarily made of lead. However, because of environmental concerns, use of 
other materials is increasing: 

•     The use of steel in some shotgun barrels may cause damage to the 
firearms. For further information, please check the manufacturer’s manual 

or contact a gunsmith. 

•     The size and number of pellets vary. They depend on the type and range 

of the target. Smaller pellets are usually used for smaller or closer targets 
(see the figure in Table 7). 

•     Sometimes a single large projectile known as a “slug” is fired from a 

shotgun. This is for hunting larger game. 

2.    Shotgun shells also contain one or more wads. The wad is made of paper, 

fibre or plastic. It separates the powder charge from the shot or slug. This 
prevents hot gas from damaging the shot and seals the gases behind the 
charge. It also separates the shot from the inside of the barrel. 

3.    The powder charge is a chemical compound in the body of the hull. It is 

ignited to propel the shot through the barrel. 

4.    The hull contains all the other ammunition components. The hull is commonly 

made of a combination of brass, plastic or paper 

5.    The primer contains a chemical mixture that explodes when the firing pin 

strikes it. This ignites the powder charge.

5.7.2. Shotgun shell types 

1.  Various types of shells exist. They vary in length, gauge, size and type of pellet 

(shot) — Table 7. To choose the right ammunition for your firearm and target, 
follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. For example, shotgun shells in 12 
gauge commonly come in several lengths as follows: 

•     70 mm (2¾ inches) 

•     76 mm (3 inches) 

•     89 mm (3½ inches) 

NOTE: These dimensions refer to the lengths of the shells after firing (Figure 
33). 

 

Figure 33. Shotgun Shells and Fired Hulls 

 It should be noted that some European shotguns are manufactured in 2- 
and 2½ inch chamber size. Firing a 2¾-inch shell in these firearms is dangerous. 
Other lengths are possible in gauge other than 12 gauge. If in doubt, check with a 

gunsmith. Actual shell length may vary slightly from these sizes. Shell 
manufacturers round off the sizes shown on the boxes.

a.  The following information is stamped on the barrel or action (Figure 35) of many 

modern shotguns. 

•     Gauge 

•     Maximum shell/chamber length 
•     Type of choke 

b.  The gauge of a shotgun shell is printed on the base of the shell. The gauge and 
the shell length are also on the ammunition manufacturer’s box. This information 

must be matched to the data stamp on the shotgun barrel prior to loading the 
firearm. If in doubt, check with a gunsmith or a gun shop. 

 

c.   If there is no data stamp, take the firearm to a gunsmith. The gunsmith can 

measure the firearm and give advice on proper ammunition. 

d.  Chamber dimensions are given for a fired shell. Use the information on the box. If 

you measured an unfired shell, you might think a 3-inch shell is only 2¾ inches 
and have an incident. 

 Do not attempt to use longer ammunition than indicated on the barrel 
data stamp. If you do, the barrel might burst (Figure 36).

Figure 35. Data Stamp on Shotgun Shell 

 Serious injuries may occur when hunters or shooters load the wrong 
ammunition into their firearms. An easy mistake to make is loading and 
chambering a 20-gauge shotgun shell into a 12-gauge shotgun. The small 

shell will slide through the chamber and stick in the forcing cone. Users may 
then insert a 12-gauge shell behind the 20-gauge shell. When fired, the barrel 
may burst (Figure 36). Burst barrels scatter metal. People have been seriously 
injured or killed by this error.

5.8. Ballistics 

a.  Ballistics is the study of projectiles in flight. 

b.  Modern firearms can shoot a long distance. For this reason, every shooter should 

understand ballistics. Shotguns can fire shot more than the length of a football 
field. Some rifles can fire bullets further than five kilometers. 

c.   A general knowledge of ballistics is important because different ammunition has 

different penetrating effects. A projectile may not stop where you want it to. 

d.  Ballistics tables for ammunition supply the information to calculate the flight path 

and performance of cartridges. 

e.  You want to hunt or shoot safely. Therefore, you need to know how far your 

projectile will travel. That means you need to know the dangerous range (Figures 
37 and 38). 

 Be sure of your target and beyond. If there is any reason your shot may 
be unsafe, do not fire.

5.9. Trajectory: 

a.  Is the path a discharged shot or bullet takes during flight (Figure 39). Several 
factors affect this path; examples include, but are not limited to, the following; 

•     Gravity pulls the bullet down toward the ground as it is travelling forward. 

This results in a downward curved path. 

•     Air resistance holds back the passage of the bullet. This slows its flight. 

•     Velocity is the speed at which a bullet travels, in a given direction. 
•     Mass is the weight of the bullet. 

b.  The firearm muzzle must be raised from the horizontal position to make up for 
gravity. The trajectory of a projectile is slightly curved. It crosses the line of sight 

twice on the way to the target. 

 

Figure 39. Trajectory of a bullet 

 Responsible shooters will follow the recommendations below: 

•     Only fire at targets within the effective range. 

•     Consider how far the shot or bullet may travel beyond the target. 
•     You are responsible for where the bullet stops. 
 - 91 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

92 

5.10. Hazards 

The selection of the correct ammunition for the firearm is critical to safe operation. 
Modern commercial ammunition is normally very reliable but there are several ways the 
cartridge may not fire. 

 

•     A misfire is a cartridge that does not fire. Misfired cartridges should not be reused in 

the firearm and must be disposed of properly. Muzzleloading firearms may also 
misfire. 

•      A hangfire is a delayed fire in which the firing pin strikes the primer but it does not 
create enough flame to ignite the powder instantly. If the muzzle is not pointed in a 
safe direction when the cartridge eventually fires, it may result in an injury. If the 

cartridge is removed from the chamber and then discharges, the explosive rupture of 
the case may also cause injury. Muzzleloading firearms may also have a hangfire. 

•     A primer pop (squib load) happens when the cartridge does not contain any 
gunpowder. The firearms will discharge the primer without the usual noise or recoil. 

This may have enough force to push the bullet out of the case, but the bullet may 
lodge in the barrel. If another bullet is fired, the barrel may rupture and possibly 
cause injury. 

 

 If the trigger is pulled and there is no noticeable discharge, wait 60 
seconds while pointing the muzzle in a safe direction. If there is no hangfire 

within 60 seconds, open the action and unload the firearm. PROVE the firearm 
safe to ensure there is no blockage lodged in the barrel. 

 

5.11. Firearm malfunctions 

 Generally, when using commercially made ammunition and a properly 
maintained firearm, malfunctions will not occur. Firearms jammed with a cartridge 

or shell in the chamber(s) can be a hazard. This hazard, if not dealt with properly, 
may result in a serious injury. Consult a qualified person or gunsmith for 
information on how to perform this function in the safest possible manner.  
 - 92 - 

MODULE 5 

93 

5.12. Ammunition precautions and legislation 

Explosives information is issued by Natural Resources Canada. It indicates that you 
may keep reasonable quantities of sporting ammunition on your property. “Reasonable” 
means quantities typically required for a rifle or shotgun, or for part of a collection. This 
ammunition must be for your private use, not resale. Contact Natural Resources 

Canada for details. You must take every necessary precaution against incidents by 
adhering to the instructions below. 

•     Ammunition must be stored out of children’s reach. It must be kept away from 

flammables. 

•     Ammunition for a non-restricted firearm may only be stored in a place where it is not 

within easy access to the firearm, unless the ammunition is stored, together with or 
separately from the firearm, in a securely locked container or receptacle that cannot 
be easily broken open or into. 

•     Ammunition for a non-restricted firearm must not be displayed with the firearm or be 

within easy access to the firearm from which it can be discharged. 

•     All ammunition should be stored in a cool, dry place, preferably in a vented 

container. This will reduce the chance of corrosion or breakdown of the ammunition 
components that could cause the firearm to jam or misfire. 

 

 

 

 

 

 Keep in mind that storing ammunition in an unvented container may 
create an explosive hazard during a fire. 

See below for a summary of 
“Ammunition Safety Points to 
Remember”.

Ammunition Safety Points to Remember 

•     Carry ammunition only for the firearm you are using. 

•     Never experiment with unfamiliar ammunition. 

•     Using modern ammunition in old firearms may be hazardous. 

•     When a misfire occurs, slowly count to 60 while pointing the muzzle in 

a safe direction. Remove the cartridge following safe procedures. 
Then, carefully inspect the bore for obstructions. 

•     Never use old or corroded ammunition or reloaded components. 

•     Never use cartridges if you are uncertain about their safe use. 

•     Never interchange smokeless powder and black powder. Use them 

only in firearms intended for their use. 

•     Store all ammunition so that unauthorized persons do not have access 

to it. 

•     Ammunition should never be displayed with a firearm. 

•     Ammunition is most safely carried in its original container. 

•     When hand loading your own ammunition, be certain to strictly follow 

the procedures in the manuals about reloading ammunition. Treat 
primers with extra caution— they are explosive devices.

•     How to identify each type of action 

•     How to locate safeties (some actions will not open unless the safety is OFF) 
•     How to pick up a gun— ACTS and PROVE it safe 

•     How to safely load each type of action, with the safety ON, whenever 

possible. 

 Always wear safety glasses and hearing protection when loading and 
discharging firearms.

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 
•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards 

yourself or any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the 
trigger guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger 

guard when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it 

safe. 

•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. 

Do this every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an 

essential rule to adopt.

PROVE it Safe 

PROVE is an acronym, or memory aid, that stands for the five steps required to ensure 
that a firearm is unloaded and safe. The five steps are: Point, Remove, Observe, Verify 
and Examine. These procedures must be followed to safely unload any firearm. 

 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction. 
2.  Remove all ammunition.  

3.  Observe the chamber(s). 

4.  Verify the feeding path. 

5.  Examine the bore(s). 

 

 The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of 
the person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. Direct control is defined as having 

the firearm within eyesight and/or an arm’s reach of the shooter.

6.1. Action types 

Firearms are generally classified by their type of action. There are six basic types 
(Figure 40). 

•     A muzzleloader is loaded through the muzzle with black powder or black-powder 
substitutes. Ignition is created by the flash produced by the hammer striking a 

percussion cap. 

•     A hinge (or break) action opens near the breech and is usually single- or double- 

barreled. 

•     A bolt action is similar to a door bolt and can be single or multiple shot. 

•     A lever action has a metal handle that opens the action. It can be single or multiple 

shot. 

•     A pump action works by pumping the fore-end of the stock back and forth and is 

normally multiple shots. 

•     A semi-automatic action extracts and ejects empty casings and inserts another 

cartridge in the chamber automatically, each time you pull the trigger.

6.2. Safeties 

6.2.0. Overview 

a.  A mechanical device known as a safety is included on most firearms to reduce 
the chances of unintentional firing. However, mechanical devices can fail. A hard 

blow may cause some firearms to fire even with the safety ON. Therefore, safe 
handling of a firearm by the person holding it will always be the most important 
firearm safety device. Always use the safety, but never rely on it to prevent firing. 

b.  The safety is designed to prevent the firearm from firing by interrupting the firing 

sequence. The safety blocks one or more of the trigger, sear, hammer or firing 
pin. 

c.   Common types of safeties on non-restricted firearms are the slide/tang, 
pivot/lever/rocker, wing, trigger block/lever, and cross-bolt or button safety 

(Figures 41 to 44). In addition, some lever action firearms and muzzleloaders use 
a half-cock safety. 

 Never rely on a safety to prevent unintentional firing. A safety can fail. 
All safeties are slightly different. Consult the owner’s manual. Different 
manufacturers may use different terminology to describe their safeties.

MODULE 6 

103 

6.2.1. Slide/tang safety 

This safety is common on shotguns and rifles (Figure 41). It is usually on the right side 

of the receiver on rifles, and the top of the receiver on shotguns. It blocks the firing 
mechanism. Some modern lever actions also have slide- or button-type safeties located 
in the action area. 

 

 

Figure 41. Side/tang safety 
6.2.2. Pivot/lever/rocker safety 

This safety is commonly found on modern firearms as well as on older military firearms 
(Figure 42). It is often located above the trigger area on the left or right side of the bolt.

6.2.3. Wing safety 

The wing safety is frequently used on the bolt of a bolt-action firearm (Figure 43). It is 
often located above the trigger area on the left or right side of the bolt. 

 

 

Figure 43. Wing Safety 
6.2.4. Trigger block/lever safety 

This safety is used on some lever action firearms (Figure 44). It is a mechanism that 
ensures the lever-action firearm will not fire unless the lever action is pressed firmly 
against the stock.

MODULE 6 

105 

6.2.5. Hammer on half-cock notch safety 

The hammer has three positions: full forward, half cock and full cock.  

•     When the hammer is fully forward resting on the firing pin, a sudden blow on the 

hammer may discharge the firearm. 

•     When the hammer is part-way-back or in half-cock position— on firearms so 

designed— the safety is considered to be ON.  

•     When the hammer is all-the-way-back on such firearms, it is in full-cock position 

and the safety is considered to be OFF. 

 The presence of a half cock on a firearm does not guarantee it is a safety. 
Some firearms do not use it as a safety. Consult the owner’s manual. Remove 
your finger from the trigger when lowering the hammer to the half-cock position 
once the hammer starts to go forward. This will re-engage any automatic safety 
linked to the trigger. Be very careful when moving the hammer in any of the three 
positions as it could slip from beneath your thumb and fire the cartridge.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

106 

6.2.6. Cross-bolt safety 

a.  The cross-bolt safety (Figure 45) is a push-button type of safety. It is common on 

many types of firearms. It works by blocking the trigger mechanism or hammer. 
b.  The safety position can be indicated in several ways as follows: 

•     Safe and fire 

•     ON and OFF switch 

•     Red means that the safety is OFF, and the firearm can be fired. 

c.   However, there is not one standard rule for indicating the safety position, and 
sometimes none of the above positions can be found on the firearm. If this is the 

case, ensure that the firearm is unloaded and pointing in a safe direction 
BEFORE checking the safety operation in the manufacturer’s manual.

6.3. Action releases 

Most firearms have some type of mechanism that must be moved to allow an action to 
be opened or closed. The location of the action release mechanism depends on the 
make and model of the firearm. 

 Do not touch any firearm unless you know how to handle it safely. 
Consult the owner’s manual or a person who knows that firearm well.

6.4. General loading and unloading procedures 

6.4.0. Overview 

Before attempting to unload a firearm, first follow the Vital Four ACTS of Firearms 
Safety and PROVE it safe. 

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 

•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards yourself or 

any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the trigger 
guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger guard 

when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it safe. 
•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. Do this 

every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an essential 

rule to adopt.

6.4.1. Unloading procedure – ACTS and PROVE it Safe 

PROVE is an acronym, or memory aid, that stands for the five steps required to ensure 
that a firearm is unloaded and safe. The five steps are: Point, Remove, Observe, Verify 
and Examine. These procedures must be followed to safely unload any firearm. 

 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure. 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure. 
•     Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the unloading process. 

2.  Remove all ammunition as follows: 

•     If the firearm has a detachable magazine, remove the magazine from the 

firearm first. Open the action to remove any ammunition from the chamber. 
(This prevents a firearm from chambering another cartridge if the action 
closes.)  

•      Leave the action open. 

3.  Observe the chamber(s) to confirm that there is no ammunition or empty 

casing(s). 

 

4.  Verify by inspecting the feeding path to make sure it is empty of ammunition, 
empty casings, or foreign objects. Make certain that you see or feel the follower, 

if one is present. 

 

5.  Examine the bore(s) for lubricant, rust or obstructions, every time you pick up a 

firearm. 

 

 The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of 
the person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. Direct control is defined as having 

the firearm within eyesight and/or an arm’s reach of the shooter.

6.4.2. Checking the barrel for obstructions 

In all of the following loading procedures, always check the barrel and chamber for 
obstructions before loading. Whenever possible, this should be done by looking 
through the barrel from the BACK or breech end. If you cannot, be certain that the 
firearm is unloaded and the action is open and the chamber empty BEFORE looking 
down the barrel from the muzzle end. Some shooters prefer to use a bore light 
inspection aid or run a rod with a patch through the barrel before loading rather than 
looking down the barrel. Use normal cleaning procedures to remove an obstruction, or 
take the firearm to an expert. 

 

 Unless the patch fills the bore completely, obstructions may not be 
detected.  

6.4.3. Loading procedure 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it, and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged. 

 

1.  Prepare the firearm for loading by going through the complete unloading 

procedure ACTS-PROVE it safe. 

2.  Clear any obstructions from the chamber(s) and bore(s). Clean if required. 

3.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the loading and 

chambering procedure. 

4.  Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this process. 

5.  Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the loading process. 

6.  Where possible, with the action open, select and load the correct ammunition by 

matching the data stamp on the firearm with the head stamp on the 
cartridge/shell or ammunition box. 

7.  Close the action. 

8.  Put the safety ON, if it is not already on.

The firearm is now loaded and ready for use. It requires continuous care and 
attention until it is unloaded. 

 Always be sure of your target and beyond. 

 

6.5. Loading and unloading the most modern common 
action types 

a.  All firearms have their own unique aspects. One of the best ways to discover the 
detailed methods for unloading and loading your particular firearm is to study the 
owner’s manual. The steps outlined in this section are not meant to replace a full 
understanding of a given firearm owner’s manual. 

b.  The following information is an introduction to the most modern common actions. 
The general procedure does not change, but the details can vary significantly. 

 Do not attempt to handle any firearm that you are not comfortable with. 
To ensure proper fit of any firearm, seek the assistance of a qualified individual. 

Before attempting to unload a firearm, follow The Vital Four ACTS-PROVE it safe.

6.6. Hinge (or break) action: single or multiple barrels 

The hinge (or break) action firearm (Figure 46) opens or “breaks” near the breech like 
the movement of a door hinge. The safety mechanism is usually located on top of the 
action above the trigger area. It is often a slide/tang safety or exposed hammer which 
must be completely down or on half cock to be safe.

PROVE It Safe 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure. 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure. 
•     Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the unloading process. 

2.  Remove all ammunition as follows: 

•     Move the action release to open the action. If the action release will not move, 

the safety may need to be moved to the OFF position. 

3.  Observe the chamber(s) to confirm that there is no ammunition or empty 

casing(s)/hull(s). 

•    Open the action by breaking the barrel open (normally it drops downward). 

This should partly extract or eject any ammunition or empty casing/hull from 
the chambers(s). If not ejected, remove them by hand. 

•    Leave the action open.  

•    Ensure that all chambers are empty of casings/hulls or live ammunition. 

4.  Verify by inspecting the feeding path to make sure it is empty of ammunition, 

empty casing(s)/hull(s), or foreign objects. 

5.  Examine the bore(s) for lubricant, rust or obstructions, every time you pick up a 

firearm. 

 The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of 
the person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. Direct control is defined as having 

the firearm within eyesight and/or an arm’s reach of the shooter.

6.8. Operating repeating firearms 

6.8.0. Overview 

a.  Many firearms are repeaters. Although they have only one chamber, they can be 

fired several times in a row because they hold more than one cartridge or shell. 
Some kind of hand movement must be made by the shooter to load another 
cartridge into the firing position. The most common repeating firearms include the 
following: 

•     Bolt action 

•     Lever action 

•     Pump action 

•     Semi-automatic action 

 
 - 120 - 

MODULE 6 

121 

b.  The extra ammunition in a repeating firearm is usually contained in some kind of 
magazine. Magazines are located in different places depending on the make, 

model and action of the firearm. There are two common types of magazines : 

•     Box 

•     Tubular  

6.8.1. Box magazine 

The usual location of a box magazine is shown in Figure 49. Some box magazines 
may be removed by depressing a button or latch. Some are not removable.

122 

6.8.2. Tubular magazine 

a.  The tubular magazine is usually found in one of two locations: 

•     Under the barrel; or 
•     In the stock. 

b.  Many tubular magazines consist of a removable inner magazine tube (which 

should be removed when unloading the firearm). 

c.   To unload tubular magazines, remove the inside tube and let the ammunition 

drop out of the end of the fixed-tubular magazine or the loading port. If the inner 
tube is not removable, close and open the action several times to be sure that 
there is no ammunition in the magazine. Take extra care in performing this 
procedure because when doing so, the firearm is in the ready-to-fire position. 

 Ammunition could hang-up in the tubular magazine, due to dirt, rust or 
dents. Always be sure you can feel or see the magazine follower to confirm that 

all the ammunition is out.

MODULE 6 

123 

 

Figure 50. Tubular-type magazine (centre-fire) 

 In most cases, using pointed centre-fire ammunition in a tubular 
magazine is hazardous. If jarred, the point on one of the cartridges may detonate 

the primer of the one in front of it. Check with ammunition manufacturers for 
compatibility.

These restrictions do not apply to rim-fire rifles, M-1 Garand rifles and other rare 
historically valuable magazines that have been specifically exempt, as well as non semi-
automatic rifles (pump, lever or bolt action). Prior to July 1993, owners of large-capacity 
cartridge magazines that were affected by the limits were able to retain them if they had 
been properly modified to comply with the limits. 

 

6.9. Bolt-action repeaters 

6.9.0. Overview 

a.  Federal, provincial and territorial laws may affect the number of cartridges you 
are allowed to have in a magazine while hunting. Consult your course instructor 

or your provincial/territorial hunting authority. 

b.  A bolt action firearm operates in a similar way to a door bolt. This action is very 

strong and is most often used on rifles. 

c.   The safety mechanism is usually located on top of the action above the trigger 

area on the left or right side of the bolt. This is often a lever type safety but can 
also be a slide/tang located directly behind the bolt (Figure 52). 

 Never rely on the firearm’s safety. Safeties can wear down and may not 
work properly. Also, a loaded firearm may fire even with the safety on. All 
mechanical devices can fail. 

Magazine-Size Limits 

Part 4 of the Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other 
Weapons, Components, and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, 
Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or 
Restricted, sets out the limits for the number of cartridges permitted 
for different types of magazines. 

For example, centre-fire semi-automatic rifles and shotguns 
including “grandfathered” full-automatics and converted full-
automatics— 5-shot magazines.

•     Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the unloading process. 
2.  Remove all ammunition as follows: 

•     Open the action by moving the bold handle (typically up and to the rear). This 

should extract and eject any ammunition or empty casing/hull from the 
chamber. If not ejected, remove it by hand. 

•     If the magazine (inner tube or box) is removable, remove the magazine. 

•     Remove any ammunition using gravity to make it fall out (typically from the 

front of the open end of the tubular magazine). 

•     If the ammunition cannot be removed in any other way, cycle all the 

cartridges through the chamber to get them out. 
•     Leave the action open. 

3.  Observe the chamber to confirm that there is no ammunition or empty 

casings/hulls.

6.9.2. Loading procedure 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it, and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged. 

1.  Prepare the firearm for loading by going through the complete unloading 

procedure— ACTS and PROVE it safe. 

2.  Select and place the correct ammunition into the magazine by matching the data 

stamp on the firearm with the head stamp on the cartridge or the ammunition 
box. 

3.  Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the loading process. 

4.  On some firearms, you must release the spring tension on the follower at this 

point. 

5.  Re-apply spring tension to the follower or insert the magazine, if necessary.  

6.  Close the action by moving the bolt handle (typically forward and downward), 

feeding and locking a cartridge into the chamber. 
7.  Put the safety ON, if it is not already on. 

The firearm is now loaded and ready for use. It requires continuous care and 
attention until it is loaded. 

 

 Always be sure of your target and beyond.

6.10. Lever-action repeaters 

6.10.0. Overview 

a.  A lever-action firearm has a metal handle located just behind the trigger (Figure 

53). This action is most often used on rifles. 

b.  In most cases, the safety mechanism is an exposed hammer. The hammer has 

three positions─ forward, half cock and full cock. When the hammer is in half-
cock position, the safety is considered to be ON. When the hammer is all-the-
way-back, it is in full-cock position and the safety is considered to be OFF. 

However, when the hammer is fully forward resting on the firing pin, a sudden 
blow on the hammer can discharge the firearm. 

c.   This type of lever action often will not fire unless the lever is fully squeezed 

against the stock depressing the trigger-block safety. 

d.  Some modern lever-action firearms also have slide/tang or cross-bolt/button 

safeties located in the action area.

6.10.1. Unloading procedure: ACTS and PROVE it safe 

 Before attempting to unload a firearm, follow the Vital Four ACTS of 
Firearm Safety, and PROVE it safe. 

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 
•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards 

yourself or any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the 
trigger guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger 

guard when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it 

safe. 

•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. Do 

this every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an 

essential rule to adopt. 
 - 131 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014

PROVE it safe 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure. 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure. 
•     Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the unloading process. 

2.  Remove all cartridges as follows: 

•     Open the action by moving the lever downward. This should extract and eject 

any cartridge or empty casing from the chamber. 

•     If the magazine (inner tubular or box) is removable, remove the magazine. 

•     If it cannot be removed, and if spring tension to the follower can be released, 

release it. 

•     If applicable, remove any cartridges using gravity to make them fall out 

(typically from the front of the open end of the box or inner-tubular magazine 
or, when not removable, from the loading port), then 

•     Reapply spring tension to the follower, if not, cycle the action repeatedly until 

the feeding path is clear (close and re-open it).  

•     Leave the action open. 

3.  Observe the chamber(s) to confirm that there is no cartridge or empty 

casings/hulls.  

4.  Verify by inspecting the feeding path to make sure it is empty of cartridges, 

empty casings/hulls or foreign objects. Make certain that you see or feel the 
follower if one is present. 

5.  Examine the bore(s) for lubricant, rust or obstructions, every time you pick up a 

firearm. 

 The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of 
the person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. Direct control is defined as having 

the firearm within eyesight and/or an arm’s reach of the shooter.

6.11. Pump-action repeaters 

6.11.0. Overview 

a.  The pump-action firearm is sometimes called the slide or trombone action 
because the fore-end of the stock is pumped back and forth to operate the 

action. It permits rapid reloading with a simple movement of the firearm- 
supporting hand without moving the muzzle away from the target. This action is 
most commonly used on shotguns. Either a box or a tubular magazine may be 
used. 
 - 133 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

134 

b.  The safety mechanism on most modern pump actions is either a slide/tang or 

cross-bolt/button safety located in the action area. The button is usually at the 
front or rear of the trigger guard. The slide/tang is frequently on top of the action. 
The action release is also found at the trigger guard (Figure 54).

6.12. Semi-automatic action repeaters 

6.12.0. Overview 

a.  This action can be found on rifles and shotguns. 

b.  With each pull of the trigger, the semi-automatic action uses part of the energy of 

the expanding gas from the burning powder to extract the empty cartridge case 
and to reload the chamber. In other words, no hand movement is needed to load 
another cartridge into the firing position; each time a cartridge is fired, another is 
loaded into the chamber (Figure 55). 

c.   Semi-automatic safeties vary considerably. The safety mechanisms commonly 
used are cross-bolt/button and slide/tang types. Occasionally, internal safeties 
such as a magazine disconnect are used. These prevent the firearm from firing 
when the magazine is not in place. 

 

 

 

                                                    Magazine-Size Limits 

 

                       Part 4 of the Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and 
                       other Weapons, Components, and Parts of Weapons, 
                       Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and 
                       Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted, sets out the limits for 
                       the number of cartridges permitted for different types of 
                       magazines. 

                       For example, centre-fire semi-automatic rifles and shotguns 
                       including “grandfathered” full-automatics and converted full-
                       automatics have 5-shot magazines.

6.13. Firearm malfunctions 

 Generally, when using commercially made ammunition and a properly 
maintained firearm, malfunctions will not occur. Firearms jammed with a cartridge 

or shell in the chamber(s) can be a hazard. This hazard, if not dealt with properly, 
may result in a serious incident. Consult a qualified person or gunsmith for 
information on how to perform this function in the safest possible manner with 
your particular firearm.

MODULE 7: SAFE HANDLING AND 
CARRYING OF NON-RESTRICTED 
FIREARMS 

7.0. Overview 

This section looks at personal safety protection and shows you how to safely handle 
non-restricted firearms in the following situations: 

•     Entering or leaving vehicles 

•     Shooting at a firing range 

•     Outdoors 

•     Shooting or hunting with a group 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it, and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged. A safe practice is not to chamber a 

cartridge until ready to fire. 

7.1. Range commands 

The following are examples of typical range commands: 
•     “The range is active” 

•     “Cease-fire” 

•     “The range is no longer active” 

 Range commands and signals vary between shooting sports, ranges and 
jurisdictions. Be sure you are aware of and clearly understand the commands 
used in your area. If you are unsure, ask the Range Officer or a local official 
before you go to the range (Appendix G: Visual Range Signals and Devices). 
 - 145 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

146 

7.2. Personal safety protection 

7.2.0. Overview 

Like many active sports, shooting has the potential to cause personal injury. The careful 
shooter takes steps to avoid these injuries by wearing personal safety protection 

7.2.1. Sight protection 

a.  There is a risk of eye injury in shooting. Shooters going through thick brush can 
be injured by twigs and branches. Target shooters also risk eye injury. This can 
come from ejected cartridge casings. It can also come from cartridge casing 

fragments and other debris ejected during firing. 

b.  To avoid these hazards, shooters should wear safety glasses made of impact- 

resistant glass or polycarbonate plastic with side shields (Figure 56). They also 
guard against firearm malfunctions, stray shotgun pellets or bullet fragments. 

 

 

Figure 56. Sight and hearing protection 
7.2.2. Hearing protection 

a.  Continued unprotected exposure to shooting noise will cause hearing loss. The 
noise level of a gunshot is similar to that of a jet engine taking off at close range. 

The need for hearing protection is obvious. 

b.  Several types of hearing protection are available. On the firing range, shooters 

should always wear headphone-type hearing protectors (Figure 56). These 
protectors provide reasonable sound protection. They can also be used for years 
with minimum maintenance. 

c.   Earplugs are available in several types. Disposable earplugs are made of foam 

or wax, but they can only be used once. 

d.  There are also reusable earplugs made of rubber available in several sizes. They 

require care and cleaning after use. 

e.  For maximum hearing protection, it is highly recommended that both earplugs 

and headphone-type hearing protectors be worn. 
 - 146 - 

MODULE 7 

147 

7.2.3. Slips and falls 

a.  The risk of slips and falls may occur when handling firearms. This can best be 

avoided by using common sense. 

b.  If you do fall, remember your first action should be to control the muzzle of the 

firearm. 

c.   In the field, pick out the safest trail. Do not depend on surrounding branches to 

support your weight. Do not cross streams on wet logs or wobbly stones with a 
loaded firearm. 

d.  Wearing deep tread high boots will reduce the possibility of slips. They will also 

protect your ankles and legs from cuts and scrapes. 

e.  It is recommended that you wear blaze orange when hunting. Some provinces 

require this by law. 

f.   Beware of cumbersome clothing like bulky jackets or wading boots. They can 

cause you to get tangled. They can also interfere with the safe handling of your 
firearm. 

 Occasionally, a hot, ejected cartridge casing may come in contact with 
unprotected skin. This can cause a shooter to flinch. The sudden movement 
could result in unsafe muzzle control or unintentional discharge. Therefore, 
button up the collar and sleeves of your shirt or blouse. This way, a hot cartridge 
casing cannot get inside.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

148 

7.3. Safety procedures on approved range 

Every range has rules of safe behaviour. These may vary but will normally include the 
standard ones shown below: 

•     The muzzle must always be pointed down range. 

•     The action of any firearm must be open at all times, except when actually shooting. 
•     Firearms must only be loaded, unloaded, and discharged at the firing line. 

•     No firearm is loaded until the command to load is given by the Range Officer. 

•     Fingers must be kept out of the trigger guard and off the trigger until the firearm is 

pointed down range. 

•     Upon the command “cease-fire,” all firing stops at once. Firearms are unloaded. 

Actions are opened. Firearms are laid on the mat or on the table. Their muzzles 
point in a safe direction down range. The shooter steps back from the firing line, 
behind the “cease-fire” line. 

•     The Range Officer will inspect each firearm before allowing anyone to go forward of 

the firing line. 

•     During a “cease-fire,” no one will handle firearms or ammunition or return to the firing 

line. At this point, wait for further range commands before any further activity. 
Persons not engaged in changing targets down range should stand well behind the 
cease-fire line. 

•     Use hearing and sight protection.

7.3.1. Additional range safety suggestions 

 In an emergency, anyone can call a “cease-fire.” 

There are other rules we recommend you follow: 

•     Minors and guests, who do not have a valid Firearms Licence, must be under direct 

and immediate supervision while shooting. Check with your range for any further 
restrictions. 

•     Firearms should be checked by the Range Officer on the “cease-fire.” This is to be 

sure that all actions are opened and no cartridges are in the breech. 

•     Unloaded firearms not in use are to be placed in the designated area with the action 

open or kept in a case. They should be moved with the muzzle pointed in the safest 
available direction or cased at the firing line. 

•     Never allow horseplay, careless handling of firearms or any other distraction while 

shooting is in progress. 

•     Make sure that you are using the correct ammunition for your firearm, and as 

approved by the range. 

•     Never shoot at target holders or other range equipment. 

•     Do not discharge firearms outside of designated range property or posted range use 

times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Where shooting activities are regularly scheduled, the CFO for a province 
or territory must issue an approval under the authority of the Firearms Act. Such 
ranges are subject to rules and procedures that may differ from province to 
province. Check with your local authorities. 

Direct and immediate supervision is defined as the supervisor 
being within arm’s reach of the shooter at all times when 
shooting activity is being supervised.

MODULE 7 

151 

7.4. Range courtesy 

There are certain standards of range courtesy. Rules and procedures vary between 
ranges. Check and obey local rules. Some of these standards are listed below: 

•     There should be a safety briefing before starting. 

•     Sign in to the firing range upon arrival, if required. 

•     Avoid interrupting or distracting others when they are shooting. 

•     Do not smoke on the firing line. 

•     Ask the owner’s or shooter’s permission before handling that person’s firearms or 

equipment. 

•     Leave enough space between you and others to ensure safety. 

•     If firing particularly smoky firearms, shoot from downwind of other shooters on the 

firing line. Black-powder firearms are especially smoky. 

•     Do not fire on other people’s targets, targets not directly down range from yourself or 

any target that may disturb others. 

•     Those firing semi-automatic firearms should take a firing point where other people 

will not be disturbed by ejected casings. 

•     Rapid firing may disturb shooters sighting-in or doing deliberate target work. 

•     When the line is clear, clean up after shooting, pick up cartridge casings and take 

down targets. 

•     Put away any range-owned equipment you have used, i.e. sandbags or bench rests.

7.5. Safe handling of firearms in vehicles 

a.  The word vehicle may include boats, cars, recreational vehicles, snowmobiles, 

sleds, private aircraft, and/or all-terrain vehicles, depending on your particular 
jurisdiction. 

b.  When handling firearms around any type of vehicle, follow the steps below: 

1.    Never have a loaded firearm in or on any vehicle unless you are allowed 

to shoot from that vehicle. Unload before entry. Load only after leaving. 
2.    It is especially difficult to control muzzle direction when entering or leaving 

vehicles. Take extra care to point the muzzle in the safest available direction 
at such times. 

3.    When a firearm is in a vehicle, it must be placed in a secure position where it 

will not be dislodged or stepped upon. 

 Check with provincial or territorial authorities in your area. They can 
inform you of how the transportation of firearms is regulated locally. 

 

 

 

                                               Example of an Incident 

 

                       A duck hunter placed his loaded shotgun into his boat and 
                       climbed in. His dog then jumped into the boat, landing on the 
                       shotgun. The firearm fired, fatally shooting the hunter in the 
                       stomach. 

                        

                       Contributing factors: 

                        •     Unsafe muzzle direction 

 

                        •     Loaded firearm in a vehicle 

                        •     Firearm in an unsecured position

7.6. Safe handling of firearms outdoors 

a.  Always remember that people or livestock you cannot see may be close enough 
to be injured. Be aware of the dangerous range of your firearm and ammunition. 

b.  Control the muzzle direction at all times. Keep the safety ON until you are 

ready to use the firearm. 

c.   Under all circumstances, protect the trigger and safety while carrying your 

firearm. A twig or branch may catch the trigger, put the safety off, or swing the 
muzzle around. 

d.  When carrying a firearm, remember that you can slip and fall causing a 
discharge. Plan how to protect the firearm and control its direction if you fall, and 

if possible, unload it before crossing uneven ground or ice. 

e.  Always be sure of your target and beyond. Don’t shoot at game near the top 

of a hill. People or livestock may be in the line of fire over the hill. Never shoot 
near a building without permission. Someone may be using it as a shelter. 

f.   Water, rocks or flat surfaces may cause the bullet to break up or ricochet. Use 

caution. 

g.  When you cross a fence or other obstacle, unload your firearm and leave the 

action open. The same goes for areas that are slippery, rocky or uneven. 

h.  When crossing a fence alone, unload the firearm and place the firearm under the 

fence. Make sure the firearm is flat on the ground with the action open and the 
muzzle pointed away from where you are crossing. 

i.    If you are in a group, one person should stand away from the crossing point. This 
person should hold the unloaded and open firearms while the others cross the 

obstacle. 

j.    When hunting alone from a pit or blind, unload your firearm and place it outside 

before entering. Then enter and bring the unloaded firearm into the pit or blind 
after you. 

k.   Remember to check your firearm for dirt if you lay it on the ground. This is 

especially important for the muzzle. 

 Use binoculars if you need to see something more clearly. Never use a 
scope mounted on a firearm as a substitute for binoculars to identify persons, 
animals or objects.

7.7. Shooting or hunting with a group 

7.7.0 Overview 

Any shot fired in the wrong direction might hit another person in your group. Make sure 
safe zones of fire are established to prevent such incidents. It is very important to follow 
the safety rules in this handbook. The rules below are especially important for shooting 
or hunting with a group. 

7.7.1. Informal firing line 

An informal firing line is an effective method to use when sighting-in or shooting in a 
field, with a group of two or more people. Follow these basic safety steps below: 

1.  Appoint someone as the Range Officer. This person will be responsible for 

supervising all of the following steps. 

2.  Follow the normal range commands and procedures. 

3.  Set up a firing line. Firearms may only be uncased, handled and loaded at this 

firing line. This must be done under the Range Officer’s direction. 

4.  Be sure that the appointed Range Officer explains the procedures to everyone in 

the group. 

5.  Decide on a safe shooting zone for each shooter. Make sure there is a safe 

backstop. This will be the only direction in which muzzles can be pointed and 
firearms fired. 

7.7.2. Safe zones of fire 

a.  It is worth emphasizing again. Any shot fired in the wrong direction by a group 
member might hit another person. This is true for all shooting situations. Before 

starting, everybody should agree on which area each shooter will cover in order 
to prevent this (Figure 60). This will clearly define each individual’s safe zone of 
fire. 

b.  Positions change when you advance through the field. You should always know 
exactly where your shooting partners are. Guard both them and yourself against 
being unintentionally shot.

7.8. Carrying positions 

Muzzle direction is all-important when carrying firearms. You can control muzzle 
direction safely if you use proper carrying positions. When carrying firearms, you must 
always be aware of the possibility of slips or falls. 

 

 

Figure 61. Two-hand or ready carry 

 

Two-hand or ready carry 

The two-hand or ready carry is the safest 
carry for shooters. It gives you the best 
control of the firearm and muzzle and 

also allows you to get into shooting 
position quickly. 

 

Cradle carry 

The cradle carry is a safe carry when 
shooting alone. However, in this carry, 
the muzzle points to one side. The 
other person has to walk on the 
opposite side of the muzzle.

open) 

 

Elbow or side carry 

The elbow or side carry is safe when 
walking in open terrain. However, do 
not use the side carry when walking 
through bush. Branches can get 
tangled around the firearm and push 
the barrel towards you. Do not use the 
side carry when others are ahead of 
you. 

 

Trail carry 

The trail carry is best used when you 
are alone or standing still. Otherwise, it 
is not recommended.

Figure 65. Shoulder carry 

 

 

Shoulder carry 

The shoulder carry is the least safe of 
all carries. In a fall there is poor 

muzzle control. It must not be used for 
loaded firearms. Special care must be 
taken to keep the muzzle pointed 
upward. Do not use this carry when 
others are with you. 

 

Sling carry 

The sling carry leaves both the hunter's 
hands free. However, do not use this 
carry when walking in dense bush. Your 
firearm may get caught in brush and be 
pulled off your shoulder. Also, twigs and 
other debris may fall into the upright 
barrel. If the hunter bends sharply 
forward, this carry is dangerous to those 
in front. 

 

Figure 66. Sling carry 

 

 Which carry you use will depend on where your companions are and the 
kind of terrain that you are walking on. Never use a carry that will cause the 
muzzle to be pointed at another person.

MODULE 8: FIRING TECHNIQUES AND 
PROCEDURES FOR NON-RESTRICTED 
FIREARMS 

8.0. Introduction to marksmanship 

a.  Marksmanship is the ability to hit your mark or target. Good marksmanship is 
important for safe shooting. If you are not certain where the bullet will go, how 

can the shot be safe? 

b.  Marksmanship depends on many factors, including anticipation, shooting 

position, aim, trigger control, controlled breathing and follow-through. These 
factors are discussed in this module. 

8.1. Anticipation 

When using a firearm, you must always be thinking about the possible situations and 
shots that may occur. The following are some examples: 

•     Will game appear suddenly? 

•     Where are the others in my shooting group? 

•     Is there a chance that the bullet will be deflected by a tree, a rock or water? 
•     Could someone be just over that hill? 

•     Where will the bullet go if it passes completely through the target? 

 Always judge the possible results of every shot carefully before firing.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

164 

8.2. Shooting positions 

8.2.0. Overview 

 If you are left-handed, reverse the procedures for each shooting position. 
Left-handed shooters should consider using firearms that are manufactured 
specifically for left-handed use. 

 

8.2.1. Rifles 

The four shooting positions for rifles are as follows: 
1.  Standing position 

2.  Kneeling position 

3.  Sitting position 

4.  Prone position 
 - 164 - 

MODULE 8 

165 

Standing position 

a.  The standing position is the least stable shooting position from which to fire. 

b.  To shoot from the standing position, first, turn your body approximately 45° to 

the right of the target. Place your feet shoulder width apart. Support the rifle 
with your left arm and hand. Hold the left arm against your body for extra 
support where possible. Hold the stock firmly against your shoulder with the 
right hand. Keep holding the rifle firmly but not tightly. 

c.   If there is too much movement, do not shoot. Rest or support the rifle on a 
stable object such as a tree or large rock. In such situations, padding beneath 

the firearm is recommended. Using a sling will help steady your shot. 

 

 

Figure 67. Standing position 
 - 165 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

166 

2.   Kneeling position 

a.  The kneeling position is better than the standing position but not as steady as 

either the prone or the sitting positions. 

b.  Turn to about a 45° angle to the target. Kneel on your right knee and place 

your left foot slightly forward. Sit on the heel or the side of the right foot. 
Place the left elbow near you but not on the bony part of the left knee, as far 
under the rifle as you can. 

 

 

Figure 68. Kneeling position 
 - 166 - 

MODULE 8 

167 

3.  Sitting position 

a.  The sitting position is one of the steadiest shooting positions. 

b.  Sit solidly on the ground, with your legs crossed or open, and your body 

positioned about 30° to the right of the line of aim. 

c.   Place your left elbow near, but not on, the bony part of the left knee. Tuck the 

elbow as far under the rifle as possible. Place the right elbow on or near the 
right knee. 

d.  Hold the rifle firmly but do not grip it tightly. If bracing your body against a tree 

or rock to steady your aim, be careful that the recoil will not force you against 
the support. 

 

 

Figure 69. Sitting position 
 - 167 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

168 

4.  Prone position 

a.  The prone position is the steadiest shooting position.  

b.  It is good for firing accurate long distance shots if tall grass or dense brush 

does not obscure the line of sight to the target. 

c.   Lie on your stomach with your body angled slightly to the left of the line of 

aim. Keep your back straight and legs in a relaxed position. The right leg 
should be bent slightly. Both elbows should be bent and your shoulders 
curved slightly forward to form a solid upper-body position. The upper body 
and arms support the rifle weight. 

d.  When shooting, you can use a rifle sling for extra support. Hold the rifle grip 

with the trigger hand. Place your opposite arm through the sling as far as it 
will go. Swing your arm in an outward circular motion, ending with your hand 
under the fore-stock of the rifle and the sling across the back of your hand.

MODULE 8 

169 

8.2.2. Shotguns 

a.  Shooting a shotgun is different from shooting a rifle. With a rifle you aim 
precisely. With a shotgun you point at the target (Figure 71). Some shotguns are 

equipped with adjustable sights and are primarily used to fire slugs. 

b.  Accurate shotgun shooting requires you to make a fast but smooth series of 

movements of the eyes, body and firearm. To achieve this, stand like a boxer: 
feet spread apart, well-balanced, arms and body free to swing right or left. This 
position allows rapid movement. 

c.   When firing, shift your body weight to the leading leg. The leading hand holds the 
shotgun fore-stock and points naturally to the target area. Point the shotgun at 

the target and slap the trigger. With moving targets, continue to follow through as 
you fire. Otherwise, the shot will miss behind the target. 

d.  Naturally, this does not apply when hunting with a rifled barrel.

8.3. Aiming your firearm 

8.3.0. Overview 

a.  Most sights are mounted on the top of the barrel (Figure 72). Their purpose is to 

help the shooter aim accurately. 

b.  There are four main types of sights: 

•     Open sights  
•     Peep sights  
•     Telescopic sights  

•     Electronic sights 

c.   Rifles and shotguns may have any of these types. 

d.  Most shotguns only have a bead mounted on the front of the barrel. This serves 

as a front sight. Your eye becomes the rear sight.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

172 

8.3.1. Aiming rifles 

 All firearms must be sighted-in for the individual prior to use. 

a.  Use your master eye for sighting. It is the stronger of your two eyes and will 
judge speed and range. It will focus more accurately (see section 8.4.1). 

b.  You must also learn to correctly use your firearm’s sight if your aim is to be 
accurate. Open sights require you to physically line up both rear and front sights 

with the target. This process is called sight alignment. When you aim any sight 
at a target, a sight picture is created.  

 

 

Figure 73. Open sights aligned on a target 

c.   Scope and electronic red-dot sights do not require conscious alignment. Scope 

sights also have the advantage of magnifying your view of the target. 
 - 172 - 

MODULE 8 

173 

d.  When preparing to aim through a scope or electronic red-dot sight, do not look 
away from the target and then try to find the target again by looking through the 

scope. Instead, while steadily watching the target, mount the firearm correctly to 
your shoulder pointing the firearm toward the target area until the scope comes 
up naturally between your eye and the target. Keep your eye well clear of the 
sight when firing. 

 Scope sights have a very narrow field of view, so you might not see a 
person or object coming into the path of your shot. Never use a mounted scope 

as a substitute for binoculars to identify persons, animals or objects.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

174 

8.3.2. Pointing shotguns 

a.  Pointing a shotgun is different from aiming other firearms. With a rifle, you must 

aim precisely. With a shotgun, you point at the target. When a shotgun is fired, 
the shot pellets spread out after leaving the barrel and hit a larger area than a 
single bullet. Therefore, precise aiming is not as necessary as with a rifle. 

b.  When using a shotgun, keep both eyes open. Focus on the moving target, not on 
the firearm barrel or the bead sight. While watching the target, place the shotgun 
to your shoulder and point it toward the target area. Be sure to place the stock 

against your cheek first, then against your shoulder. This positions the firearm in 
exactly the same position each time you shoot  

c.   Some shotguns are equipped with adjustable sights and are primarily used to fire 
slugs. For this type of shotgun, use the same aiming techniques as you would for 
a rifle.

8.4. Fundamentals of shooting 

8.4.1. Sight alignment 

 To find out which is your master eye, create a triangle using both hands 
as illustrated in Figure 76. With both eyes open, view an object in the distance 
from the centre of the triangle. With both eyes remaining open, and keeping the 
object within the triangle, close the left eye and then open the left eye. Then, 
close the right eye and then open the right eye. The master eye will keep the 
object in the centre of the triangle. 

 

 

Figure 76. Determining your master eye 
8.4.2. Breathing as it relates to shot release 

a.  Holding one’s breath is not natural. Since there is no gauge on the lungs, it’s not 
possible to judge just how much air is held for each shot release. The shot must 
be released in the natural pause in the breathing cycle. 

b.  We breathe in, we breathe out. There is a natural pause at the bottom of each 
exhale. It is this natural pause (2.5 seconds) that the shot must be released in. In 

order to lengthen this natural pause, the shooter has to breathe in deep, force the 
breath out deeper than normal, breathe in deep again, this time let the breath out 
normally. The natural pause in the breathing cycle has just been increased to 

approximately 8.5 seconds. That is plenty of time to confirm sight picture and 
release the shot, if not, just repeat the process. Breathe in deep, force it out, 
breathe in deep again, let it out NATURALLY and squeeze the shot off. 

c.   Figure 77 has been in circulation for over forty years. Unfortunately, some people 

will sometimes misinterpret it and wrongfully revert to holding their breath.

8.4.3. Trigger control 

Trigger control is essential for accurate shooting. 

a.  Rifles 

When the sights are aligned on the target, squeeze the trigger slowly and 

steadily. Avoid yanking or pulling. Anything other than a smooth squeeze will 
cause the firearm to move and send the shot off target. Relax before the firearm 
fires to allow each shot to happen almost as a “surprise”. 

b.  Shotguns 

Shotgun triggers are slapped instead of squeezed. The trigger slap is similar to 

the action of striking a typewriter key. Slap the trigger quickly, but not hard. 
8.4.4. Follow-through 

This means maintaining your sight picture and/or shooting position, after discharging the 
firearm. If you do not follow-through, it is more likely that your shot will be “off target.” 

8.5. Targets 

8.5.1. Acceptable targets 

•     A target that is positively identified 
•     A target that is safe to shoot at 

•     A target that can be lawfully shot 

8.5.2. Unacceptable targets 

•     A target that you are not sure of, cannot clearly see and cannot identify 
•     A target that cannot be shot safely 

•     A target that is not legal to shoot 

 

 Check with local or provincial authorities for specific rules and 
regulations.

9.1 Firearm servicing 

 Ensure that all firearms are unloaded and ACTS/PROVE it safe before 
attempting to clean. Refer to Module 6 for information on unloading procedures, 

ACTS and PROVE it safe. 

a.  Always be sure your firearm is functioning properly. A firearm that does not work 

properly is an unsafe firearm. 

b.  This module on minor maintenance and servicing procedures for your firearm is 

included for general information only. Specific information on cleaning and 
servicing your firearm is available in your firearm owner’s manual, at a gun shop, 
or from a gunsmith. Incidents can occur if these procedures are not performed 
correctly. 

c.   Firearms are precision instruments. Even minor repairs should be made by 
qualified individuals. Unqualified persons should never try to repair or modify any 

firearm. 

d.  The average user should do basic cleaning and lubrication only. 

 

 

 

                                                 Example of an Incident 

 

                         Someone was preparing to clean a loaded firearm with the 
                         action closed, and dropped it. The rifle fired when it hit the 
                         floor. Someone in the next room was killed. 

                          

                         The contributing factor was as follows: 

                          •     Failing to ACTS/PROVE the firearm

9.2. Firearm cleaning 

9.2.0. Overview 

a.  Information on cleaning firearms safely may be obtained from your firearm 
owner’s manual. If you do not have one, contact the manufacturer. Incidents can 

happen if the cleaning procedure is not performed correctly. 
b.  The two major threats to firearm safety are the following: 

•     Rust caused by moisture and condensation 

•     Excessive build-up of residue or rust in the firearm 

c.   Either may cause excessive pressure, damaging the barrel. This is why regular 

cleaning is recommended. 

d.  The barrel of a firearm should be cleaned after every use. This will protect its 

finish. It will also help keep it in good working order. For instructions on cleaning 
the rest of the firearm, consult your owner’s manual. 

e.  Modern smokeless primers and powders are non-corrosive. However, some 
older military surplus ammunition still contains corrosive chemicals. If you use 

corrosive ammunition, you should clean your firearm immediately after you use it. 
f.   Any firearm that has been stored for a long time must be cleaned thoroughly 

before use. Cleaning before using is required when the firearm has been 
exposed to moisture or dirt. 

 If cleaning your firearm requires disassembly, consult your owner’s 
manual. You should wear safety glasses if disassembly is required. Oil or 
moisture can be very dangerous in cold weather. They may cause safeties and 
other firing mechanism parts to freeze in a firing position. Later, when the firearm 
thaws, it may fire. Residue or rust in the chamber or barrel may cause serious 
pressure build-up. Also, oil may mix with unburnt powder and other dirt, causing 
the firearm to jam.

9.2.1. Cleaning materials 

a.  To clean a firearm properly, you need the following materials: 

•     A cleaning rod or a pull-through and attachments (be sure to use the right 

size for the firearm), such as: 
o    A bore brush, 

o    Tips to hold cloth patches; 

•     Patches, 

•     Powder solvent (also called “bore cleaner”), 
•     Gun oil, and 

•     A soft cloth. 

b.  If possible, clean your firearm from the breech toward the muzzle. Avoid cleaning 

from the muzzle toward the breech (Figures 78 and 79). 

c.   However, you may have to clean some types from the muzzle end. In this case, 

lock the breech open. This permits the passage of the cleaning rod completely 
through the barrel. You will find a pull-through cleaning device helpful. Avoid 
rubbing the cleaning rod on the muzzle. Damage to the muzzle may occur. It is 
beneficial to insert a cloth into the open action to collect residue, to prevent dirt 
from entering the action, and to prevent damage to the firearm. 

d.  When cleaning a bolt action, remove the bolt, if possible. Clean the firearm from 
the breech end. Some firearms are easier to clean if you remove the barrel first. 

 While cleaning a firearm, remember and follow the Vital Four ACTS-
PROVE it safe. The following additional recommended practices for home safety 

with firearms might prevent incidents: 

•     Make sure no ammunition is nearby during cleaning. 

•     Never allow a loaded firearm in any building or living area. 

•     Always give cleaning your firearm your full attention. Never clean a firearm 

while during something else, like watching television.

9.2.2. Cleaning procedures 

The firearms cleaning procedures are as follows: 

1.  ACTS and PROVE it safe. 

2.  Attach the bore brush to the cleaning rod. Apply bore cleaner to the brush. 

3.  Run the brush through the bore of the firearm barrel several times. Be sure that 

the brush sticks out from the barrel completely. Then, draw it back through the 
barrel (Figure 78). 

4.  Remove the bore brush from the cleaning rod. Attach a patch-holder tip and a 
proper size cloth patch. Pour solvent on the cloth patch. Run it through the bore 

several times. Remove the cloth patch from the rod tip. 

5.  Next, run a clean, dry patch through the bore several times. 

6.  If the patch comes out dirty, repeat the first four steps. Do this until a patch finally 

comes through clean. 

7.  Next, run a lightly oiled patch through the bore. Use only light gun oil. 

8.  Wipe the outside of the firearm with a clean cloth and apply a light coat of gun oil 
or rust preventative to the metal surfaces. You should also maintain the condition 
of the stock by applying the appropriate treatment (consult the owner’s manual). 

9.  Always store your firearm properly. 

10. Don’t forget to clean your magazine 

11. Remember, before the next firing of the firearm, run a dry patch through the 

barrel to remove any oil. 

 Make sure you wash your hands after the cleaning procedure.

9.2.3. Ammunition storage 

a.  Ammunition should also be kept clean and dry. Oil, sand or dirt on the cartridge 

or shell can damage the firearm. It could also cause jamming of the action. 

b.  Avoid exposing your ammunition to heat and vibration. Powder can decay and 

become unpredictable if exposed to excessive heat and long-term vibration. 

 Primers are adversely affected by exposure to penetrating oils. Do not 
clean your ammunition with an oily rag. Before using any firearm, remove oil or 

grease from inside the barrel. Increased pressure caused by dirt or oil may cause 
the barrel to burst. This comes from the pressure generated in a dirty barrel when 
a bullet is fired through it. After storage, and before you use the firearm again, 

run a clean patch through the bore. Remove all grease and oil. Always ensure 
that your firearm is in good working order. Ensure that you have followed the 
Vital Four ACTS in order to PROVE it safe before attempting to clean and 

throughout the entire cleaning procedure. Refer to Module 6: Operating Firearms 
Actions on unloading procedures.

MODULE 10 

189 

MODULE 10: SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
OF THE FIREARMS OWNER/USER 

10.1. Firearm-related incidents 

a.  The main purpose of this course is to promote the safe use and handling of 
firearms. Increased safety awareness will help prevent both the unintentional and 

deliberate misuse of firearms. 

b.  Most safety courses concentrate on the prevention of an unintentional discharge 

when handling firearms. A firearm generally causes more serious injuries than 
any other type of weapon. 

c.   Suicides and homicides are often acts of sudden impulse. Many of them might 
not have happened if the firearms and ammunition were stored safely. For this 
reason, this course stresses the safe handling and use of non-restricted firearms 

and ammunition and their secure storage. 

10.2. Intentional misuse of firearms 

10.2.0. Overview 

a.  The intentional misuse of firearms, resulting in suicide and homicide, has fallen 

since the eighties. Misuse of firearms, resulting in unintentional discharge, has 
also fallen. 

b.  The misuse of firearms can lead to tragic results. The same applies to the misuse 

of automobiles, power tools and even kitchen knives. 
10.2.1. Signs of risk 

a.  You can sometimes anticipate violent situations before they happen. Remember, 

these events can happen in our own homes, those of friends or neighbours. 

b.  When these situations seem to be developing, it is good practice to remove all 

firearms. This is true even when firearms are properly stored. Consider storing 
the firearms at an alternate location, and if necessary, notify the police of the 
situation. 

c.   Consider notifying your Chief Firearms Officer through the concern line at 1-800-

731-4000. 

d.  You would not hesitate to prevent a friend or relative from drinking and driving. 

Do not hesitate to prevent the misuse of firearms. 
 - 189 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

190 

e.  Your Chief Firearms Officer will determine the continued eligibility of individuals 

to keep firearms. 

 In an emergency, for public or your own safety, immediately contact your 
local police service. In case of concern for public or your own safety, contact  
1-800-731-4000. 

10.3. Firearms reported lost, missing or stolen 

Owners of firearms are required under the Criminal Code to report the loss or theft of 
their firearms. 

Report the loss or theft of a firearm: 

to your local police service, and;  

the Canadian Firearms Program at 1-800-731-4000. 
10.4. Secure storage 

a.  Secure storage is the best way to limit theft and deliberate misuse of firearms. It 

should not be easy for unauthorized individuals to gain access to firearms and 
ammunition. 

b.  Do not leave the key or combination to the firearm storage area or container lying 

around. Do not give them out to others. Also, do not let it become widely known 
that you have firearms. 

c.   Locking up firearms and ammunition is important and is required by the Firearms 

Act and its Regulations.  If you require more information, please refer to it. 

d.  Make access to firearms and ammunition difficult. If firearms and ammunition are 

difficult to get, there may be a delay in acting on the impulse to do harm. This 
delay may be enough to make the impulse decrease or go away. 
 - 190 - 

MODULE 10 

191 

e.  Secure storage of firearms and ammunition may act as a deterrent to easy theft 

by criminals. Remember: you are legally and morally responsible for your 
firearms 24 hours a day. By law, you must store them safely and securely when 
you are not physically in control of them. This may cause some inconvenience, 
but it may also save a person from death or serious injury. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Unsafe storage of firearms is a criminal offence. Unsafely stored firearms 
may be misused. You and you alone will be held accountable (i.e., criminal 
negligence causing death, bodily harm, etc.). 

Please refer to MODULE 11: SAFE STORAGE 
DISPLAY, TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING 
OF NON-RESTRICTED FIREARMS.

MODULE 10 

193 

10.6. Social responsibilities and ethics 

a.  As a firearm user, you have certain legal obligations to the community at large. In 

some cases, however, sticking to the letter of the law is not enough. The spirit of 
the law must also be followed. The welfare and well-being of your fellow citizens 
must come first. 

b.  Below are some moral and social rules. They must be part of the code of ethics 

for anyone possessing firearms. 

•     Store all firearms and ammunition properly. Keep your firearms and 

ammunition properly secured and out of sight. 

•     Explain firearms safety to all family members. Everyone in a home where 

firearms are kept should know the safety rules. Firearms are no different than 
dangerous tools or poisons in the home. Proper use and handling of firearms 
and ammunition must be taught to the entire family. The key or combination 

number to secure locking devices should be kept away from and out of the 
reach of children and unauthorized adults. 

•     Remove firearms from situations of potential violence. You may become 

aware of a situation where violence or tragedy could occur. In such cases, it 

is wise to go beyond the safe storage of firearms. Completely remove 

firearms that may be present. If this is not possible, at least notify the police of 
the situation. 

•     Act sensibly and carefully while around firearms. Always pay close 
attention to what you and others around you are doing. Make sure that 
everyone is acting safely and responsibly. 

•     Never consume drugs or alcoholic beverages when around firearms. Do 

not go shooting with anyone who has. Alcohol and drugs can affect your 
mental or physical reactions. Both prescription and non-prescription drugs 
can affect your alertness, senses and balance. Some types of allergy 
medicines are a good example. Always stay fully alert when around firearms. 

•     Always get permission before shooting on someone else’s property. 
Make sure that you are welcome and permitted before you shoot anywhere. 

Do this whether the land belongs to the crown, to a local club, or to a private 
citizen. Make sure that you can shoot there safely. For example, someone 
else may be shooting there at the same time. Check with local authorities. 

•     Have your eyesight checked regularly. Shooting requires good vision for 

target identification and accuracy. Be sure of your target and beyond. 

•     Maintain your firearm in good working order. If required, have a qualified 

gunsmith service your firearm. 
 - 193 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

194 

•     Avoid firing near buildings or roads. Respect the rights of others to safe 
travel and undisturbed use of their property. Only shoot near buildings with 
authorized permission, and only if it is legal and safe. 

•     Know and respect firearms regulations and local by-laws.  

•     Wear safety equipment. Encourage others to do the same. Safety 

equipment may include, but should not be limited to, sight and hearing 
protection, gloves, caps and proper clothing.

11.1. Classes of firearms 

11.1.0. Overview 

The table below provides a brief description of non-restricted firearms. For legal 
references, however, please refer to the Firearms Act and its Regulations, and Part III 
of the Criminal Code for a description of restricted and prohibited classes. Call 1-800-
731-4000 for further information. 

 

Table 18. Non-restricted Firearms 

 

Non-restricted Firearms 

Generally, firearms commonly used for hunting or sporting 
purposes such as target shooting are included in this class. 
The following are examples of non-restricted firearms: 

•     Rifles 

•     Shotguns 

 

 It must be noted that some rifles and shotguns are considered restricted 
or prohibited. Persons wishing to acquire such firearms should contact a 
firearms officer for further information. 

11.2. Ammunition 

11.2.0. Overview 

For a complete description of ammunition, prohibited ammunition and prohibited 
devices, consult Part III of the Criminal Code of Canada. Call 1-800-731-4000 for 
additional information. 
 - 197 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

198 

11.2.1. Ammunition 

Is a cartridge containing a projectile designed to be discharged from a firearm. This 
includes caseless cartridges and shot shells. 

11.2.2. Prohibited ammunition 

Individuals cannot acquire prohibited ammunition; i.e. tracer rounds, because they could 
start a fire.  

11.2.3. Prohibited devices 

Individuals cannot acquire prohibited devices; i.e. high-capacity magazine (except for 
rim fire cartridges), silencer.  

 Refer to the appropriate sections of the Firearms Act and its Regulations 
for detailed requirements relating to the storage, display, transportation and 
handling of non-restricted firearms. 

a.  Remember, you are responsible for your firearms 24 hours a day. Anyone 
who owns or uses a firearm must meet safe storage, display, transportation and 

handling requirements. These requirements are set out in the Storage, Display, 
Transportation and Handling of Firearms by individuals Regulations. All of these 
are described in this module. 

b.  Firearms owners and users should always assume that anyone untrained in the 
safe handling and use of firearms does not know how to handle firearms safely. 
Serious incidents could occur from unauthorized access, especially where 

children are concerned. To prevent this, always store, display, transport and 
handle firearms and ammunition in accordance with the regulations. 

c.   Remember, the law requires that all firearms must be unloaded except when 

in use. 
 - 198 - 

MODULE 11 

199 

11.3. Storage 

a.  A non-restricted firearm may be stored only under the following conditions: 

1.    It is unloaded by the ACTS and PROVE it safe, and either: 

•     Rendered inoperable by using a secure locking device or 

•     By removing the bolt or bolt-carrier or 

•     Stored in a securely locked opaque container, receptacle, or room that 

cannot be easily broken open or into (Figures 80-82); and 

2.    It is not within easy access to ammunition, unless the ammunition is stored, 

together with or separately from the firearm, in a securely locked container or 
receptacle that cannot be easily broken open or into. 

 Keep in mind that storing ammunition in an unvented container may 
create an explosive hazard during a fire. 

b.  In areas where it is legal to discharge a firearm, a non-restricted firearm used for 
predator control may be stored temporarily unlocked, and out in the open, as 

long as it is unloaded, and not readily accessible to ammunition. 

c.   In a remote area where hunting might reasonably occur, a non-restricted firearm 

may be stored unlocked, out in the open and accessible to ammunition as long 
as the firearm is unloaded.

11.5. Transportation 

a.  A non-restricted firearm must be transported unloaded. 

b.  However, loaded-muzzleloading firearms may be transported between hunting 

sites if the percussion cap or flint is removed— subject to provincial/territorial 
regulations. 

c.   You may leave a non-restricted firearm in an unattended vehicle if it is unloaded 

and placed in a locked trunk or a similar compartment of the vehicle. 

d.  If the unattended vehicle does not have a trunk or a similar compartment, lock 

the vehicle or the part of the vehicle that contains the non-restricted firearm and 
leave the non-restricted firearm inside, unloaded and out of sight. 

e.  In a remote area when hunting might reasonably occur, you may leave a non-
restricted firearm in an unattended vehicle that has no trunk or compartment that 

can be locked (i.e. canoe, snowmobile), if it is out of sight. The non-restricted 
firearm must be unloaded and rendered inoperable by a secure locking device 
unless you require it for predator control. 

f.   If you live in a rural area and need reasonable access to your non-restricted 
firearm for predator control, you may be exempted from some of the storage and 

transportation requirements. Check with a local firearms officer, a wildlife or 
conservation officer to confirm that provincial or municipal laws allow storage on 
a temporary basis. 

 If you want to transport firearms on an aircraft, you should first contact 
the air carrier. The air carrier will provide information on its regulations and 
requirements.

11.6. Handling 

a.  Before obtaining a firearm, think about how you will carry it home and where you 

will keep it. Remember, when you leave the seller or dealer’s shop, you will be 
carrying your firearm in a public place. It is recommended that all firearms be 
carried in a case or opaque container to avoid display in public (Figure 85). 
Consult your local authorities for details. 

b.  There are locations where having or discharging a firearm violates federal or 
provincial/territorial Acts and Regulations, or municipal bylaws. It may also be an 

offence to load or handle firearms in these places. You may load a firearm or 
handle a loaded firearm only in a place where it is lawful to discharge it. 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged. Always be sure of your target and beyond.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CANADIAN 
RESTRICTED FIREARMS SAFETY COURSE 

Overview 

The Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course (CRFSC) is designed to apply to 
novice restricted firearm users. Existing firearms safety courses across Canada have a 
proven track record in the reduction of firearm-related incidents. However, these 

courses have been designed and delivered for firearms use in a specific activity. The 
CRFSC is an introductory firearms safety course intended for all new restricted firearms 
users and those individuals who wish to acquire restricted firearms. 

The Canadian Firearms Program 

The Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) is administered by the RCMP/CFP, which 

works with provincial Chief Firearms Officers and many community partners across the 
country in implementing the Firearms Act and its regulations, and other related 

legislation regarding firearms. 

The goal of the Canadian Firearms Program is the safe and responsible use of firearms, 
and it includes a range of activities directed toward achieving that goal such as the 
following: 

•     The licensing of all firearm owners and businesses; 

•     The delivery of the Canadian Firearms Safety Courses; 

•     Public education regarding safe storage, transport and use of firearms; and 

•     Import and export controls. 

Licensing, registration and other Program information are recorded in the Canadian 
Firearms Information System, a national database that is managed by the CFP. Certain 
information is available to law enforcement agencies to help them prevent and 
investigate firearms incidents and crime, consistent with the public safety objectives of 
the Firearms Act.  

Your personal information is carefully protected by the Canadian Firearms Program, 
consistent with the Firearms Act and its Regulations, federal and provincial privacy laws 
and other applicable statutes.

The RCMP/CFP wishes you the best in following the Canadian Restricted Firearms 
Safety Course for the class(es) of firearms you wish to acquire and/or possess. Please 
note that all Canadian Restricted Firearm Safety Course instructors and examiners 
must be designated by the Chief Firearms Officer for the province or territory in which 
you are taking the course. 

Course objectives 

Firearm owners have social responsibilities. By completing this course, Students will be 
instructed on what these responsibilities are. They will learn how to do the following: 

•     Handle restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Use restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Comply with firearms laws. 

•     Store restricted firearms and ammunition safely. 

•     Display restricted firearms safely. 

•     Transport restricted firearms safely. 

The Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course consists of two parts. One is 
classroom instruction. The other is learning the material in this handbook. There will be 
both written and practical examinations. Passing them will demonstrate the knowledge 
and skills you have gained in the course. Live firing exercises, however, are not offered 
as part of this course. 

During the course, some topics are discussed and explored several times. This will help 
you learn and retain the content. Leaving anything out of the course will reduce the 
amount you learn. This applies to all assignments, exercises or examinations given by 
your instructor. 

The course emphasizes safe storage, display, transportation, handling and use of 
restricted firearms. Safety depends on more than just safe physical actions. 
 - 216 - 

INTRODUCTION 

217 

Safe handling must include greater knowledge of the firearms themselves, ammunition, 
and the laws and regulations related to them. 

Course handbook 

Safety also relies on your attitude about responsible handling and use of firearms. Pay 
close attention to the section on legal, ethical and social responsibilities. The safety of 
the people around you depends on it. Your own safety also depends on it. 

This book is an essential part of the course. The other parts are the classroom lessons 
and practical exercises given by the instructor. Together, they will help you learn how to 
safely handle firearms. 

This book contains the following elements: 
•     The Vital Four ACTS of firearm safety 
•     A brief history of restricted firearms 

•     Information on restricted firearms and ammunition and how they work 

•     Instructions on how to pick up, handle and carry restricted firearms safely 

•     Descriptions of how to unload, load and fire restricted firearms safely 

•     Descriptions of firing positions 

•     Instructions on range safety 

•     Instructions on the care and cleaning of restricted firearms 

•     Examples of factors leading to firearm incidents and the misuse of firearms 

•     A summary of ethics and laws affecting firearm owners and users 

•     Information on how to store, display, transport and handle restricted firearms safely 

•     A glossary of firearm terms 

•     Appendixes 

This is an introductory course. More information and training is available on the various 
shooting sports from their own qualified instructors, associations and local clubs. We 
recommend you contact them directly for further details. 

Do not hesitate to contact provincial/territorial or local authorities for more detailed 
information on firearm laws and regulations in your area.

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

Your instructor will refer to many different safety rules and guidelines. Time and again, 
the instructor will return to four basic rules. Any time you hear of an incident occurring, 
you can be sure at least one of these rules has been broken. These rules are known as 

the Vital Four ACTS. 

The first letter of each rule becomes a letter in the acronym ACTS. You may want to 
think of these rules as acts you must carry out. 

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•  Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•  Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•  Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 

•  The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards yourself or 

any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the 
trigger guard. 

•  Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger guard 

when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•  Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it safe. 
•  Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. Do this 

every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•  Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an essential 

rule to adopt. 
 - 218 -

affecting the use of firearms and ammunition. 

b.  Going beyond what the regulations require will increase your safety. Some 

suggestions are listed below: 

•     Keep an inventory of your firearms. Also keep any supporting documents 

such as photographs and owner's manuals. Store these documents in a safe 
place. This will help you describe any firearms that may be stolen or lost. It 
will also be easier for you to find your owner's manual and records of service 
or repair. 

•     Keep informed. Changes may occur in laws and regulations from time to time. 
This can happen at any level, whether at the federal, provincial/territorial or 

municipal. 

•     Avoid advertising about the firearms in your home. You may be inviting theft. 

 Every person commits an offence who, without lawful excuse, points a 
firearm at another person, whether the firearm is loaded or unloaded, and is: 

1.   guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 

exceeding five years; or 

2.   guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction (a fine of $5,000 

and/or six months imprisonment).

MODULE 12: RESTRICTED FIREARMS 
MUZZLELOADER 

12.1. Black powder and projectiles 

12.1.1. Black powder 

a.  Muzzleloading firearms use black powder and lead balls as ammunition. There 

are also black-powder substitutes. 

b.  Black powder is available in four different types. 

Table 10. Types of Black Powder 

Fg              Very coarse granules of powder. Used in larger bore 

muskets. 

FFg           Finer granules than the Fg. Used in muzzleloading shotguns, 

big-bore rifles and single-shot pistols of .45 calibre and up. 
FFFg         Finer granules than the FFg and the most common type. 

Used in nearly all cap and ball revolvers. 

FFFFg       The finest granules. Used only in the priming pans of 

flintlocks. Never use this powder as powder charge. 

c.   Remember, the finer the granules of powder, the more pressure it creates when 

fired. 

d.  Black powder ignites very easily. A glowing coal, a spark, even static electricity or 

a sharp blow may ignite it. Handle black powder with great care, especially when 
transporting it. Black powder should be stored in a secure, cool dry place and 
always in its original container. 

e.  As black powder ages, it becomes more unstable. When stored for long periods, 

the granules will begin to cake together and white crystals will form. When this 
happens, the black powder has become very unstable. It should be soaked 
immediately in water. 
 - 224 - 

MODULE 12 

225 

 Never use FFFFg powder as anything other than a priming powder. Black 
powder ignites easily. Always handle with extreme care and wear eye protection. 
Never have a source of ignition around powder. Never smoke near black powder. 
Glowing embers may be present in the bore after firing a black powder firearm. 

An explosion hazard could be created if you proceed immediately to reload. 
Never interchange smokeless powder and black powder. Use them only in 
firearms intended for their use. 

12.1.2 Black powder projectiles 

Modern black powder or muzzleloading firearms shoot several different types of 
projectiles as follows: 

•     Spherical - round ball, usually loaded along with a lubricated patch, which seals the 

barrel around the ball 

•     Conical - cylindrical-shaped projectiles known as Mini-balls, they have a hollow base 

that expands to seal the gases when the firearm fires 

•     Shot - pellets of assorted sizes and materials 

•     Sabot - plastic or synthetic carrier that encases a projectile.

12.2. Muzzloading firearms 

12.2.0. Overview 

a.  Muzzleloading handguns are still in use today. However, most modern 

muzzleloaders are reproductions of older designs  

b.  This type of firearm is loaded through the muzzle. A measured amount of powder 

with a volumetric measure and poured it through the muzzle into the barrel, 
followed by a patch, and finally a lead ball or shot. A hole located at the rear of 

the barrel just above the trigger allows a flash or spark to enter the barrel through 
the priming port and ignite the powder, firing the charge. 

c.   With flintlock muzzleloaders, the igniting spark is the result of the flint, held by the 

cock, hitting the frizzen. On percussion muzzleloaders, the flash is produced by 
the hammer striking a percussion cap. 

d.  Muzzleloading firearms use black powder or black powder substitutes. Black 
powder is classified as an explosive and is easily ignited by friction, a hard blow 

or even static electricity. It must be handled with extreme care. It is strongly 
recommended that individuals interested in muzzleloading seek additional 
training from specialists in the field.

 Older firearms should be inspected by a qualified gunsmith to be sure 
they can be fired safely. 
 - 226 - 

MODULE 12 

227 

12.2.1. Loading muzzleloaders 

a.  Today most firearms for black powder use are reproductions of muzzleloaders. 
Older firearms may not be safe to fire and should be checked by a gunsmith 

before use. 

b.  If a muzzleloader is not primed to fire, it is safer to handle. To ensure that a 

muzzleloader is not primed to fire, do the following: 

1.  Point the muzzle in the safest available direction and keep your finger off the 

trigger and out of the trigger guard. 

2.  Check that the hammer is not in full-cock position. 

3.  Check for the presence of priming powder in the percussion cap or in the 

priming pan. 

4.  If the firearm is primed, remove the percussion cap or the priming powder. 

c.   In addition, it is difficult to tell if there is already a charge loaded into the barrel of 
a muzzleloader. Shooters should mark the firearm’s ramrod at a level that shows 
the bore depth when the bore is empty (Figure 88). When the marked ramrod is 
inserted into the barrel, it shows whether or not the firearm is loaded. 

 For other models of muzzleloading firearms, check with the manufacturer 
for specific safety features and information regarding the loading and unloading 
process.  
 - 227 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

228 

 

Figure 88. Correctly marked ramrod 

 

 It is very important that exact loading and unloading procedures are 
followed when handling muzzleloaders (Figure 89). Before attempting it, get the 

assistance of a qualified individual and carefully follow the instructions in your 
owner’s manual. Ensure that firing mechanism (lock) is rendered safe before 
proceeding to load the firearm. Before loading the firearm, use a rod with a tight 
fitting patch to clean the bore, and fire a cap to remove oil from the bore and flash 
port.

Figure 90. Loading a muzzleloader (continued) 

d.  In black powder revolvers, a measured amount of powder is poured into each 

chamber. A ball is firmly seated on each charge. Grease or lubricant is placed on 
top of each ball to lubricate its travel down the barrel and prevent “chain-firing” of 
all chambers. A percussion cap is put on the nipple of each chamber that 

produces the flash.  

 
 - 230 - 

MODULE 12 

231 

 Never use smokeless powder in a muzzleloader. Never use black powder 
in a modern cartridge firearm not designed for it. Always use a volumetric 
measure to put powder into the muzzle. Never pour directly from the main powder 
container. In compliance with firearms safe storage regulations, a muzzleloader 
with powder in the barrel is considered loaded. 

12.2.2. Cleaning a muzzleloader 

a.  A black powder firearm must be properly cleaned after every firing session. Black 

powder is very corrosive. It attracts moisture, which causes rust. 

b.  Cleaning black powder firearms improperly can result in carbon build-up in the 

barrel, which may cause coking. This condition may cause a glowing ember to 
remain after firing, resulting in a dangerous situation if the firearm is reloaded. 

c.   Use either commercial black powder cleaning solvent or hot, soapy water. 

d.  You will also need a ramrod with a cleaning patch attached. Use a rod as close 

to the bore diameter as possible. Refer to the owner’s manual. 
e.  Use wet patches to soften the dried powder. 

1.  Detach the barrel and place the lock end in a container of soapy water. 

2.  Attach a patch to the ramrod. Insert the ramrod into the barrel. Pump the 

ramrod up and down until water flows from the top end of the barrel. 

3.  Repeat step 2. Change the water as it becomes dirty. Repeat until the water 

stays clean. 

4.  Dry the barrel out with several dry patches. Oil thoroughly with good gun oil. 

5.  Remove the lock for cleaning, if possible, and oil after every use. 

f.   If cleaning a black powder revolver, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the 

proper cleaning methods. 

 It is strongly recommended that persons interested in muzzleloading 
seek additional training from experienced individuals.

12.2.3. DOs and DON’Ts of muzzleloading 

•     Do have old muzzleloading firearms dismantled, examined and declared safe by 

a qualified gunsmith before using them. 

•     Do handle the muzzleloader with the same respect due all firearms. 

•     Do use ONLY black powder or black powder substitutes (i.e., Pyrodex) in your 

muzzleloader, never use smokeless powder. 

•     Do keep black powder far away from all cigarettes, matches/wicks or anything 

with an open flame, embers or anything that may cause sparks or heat. 

•     Do always use a volumetric measure to pour powder directly into the muzzle. 

Never use the powder horn or flask. 

•     Do carefully follow the manufacturer's recommendations for maximum powder 

charge. 

•     Do mark your ramrod to indicate when the barrel is empty and when it is loaded. 

•     Do wipe the bore clean of oil and excess grease before you load. 

•     Do make sure the ball or bullet is seated firmly on the powder charge. 

•     Do place grease in front of each projectile in a black powder revolver to prevent 

chain-firing. 

•     Do treat a misfire as a hangfire that could fire at any second. Wait at least 60 

seconds with the firearm pointed in a safe direction. 

•     Do wear safety glasses and hearing protection. 

•     Do reseat your second charge after firing and reloading a single barrel on a 

multiple-barrel black-powder firearm. Recoil can move the charge forward. 
 - 232 - 

MODULE 12 

233 

 

•     Don't carry or handle a muzzleloading firearm with the hammer at full cock and 

primed unless you are ready to fire. 

•     Don't lean over or stand in front of the muzzle at any time. 

•     Don't load one chamber of a muzzleloading-multiple barrel or revolving handgun 
unless the percussion caps on the nipples of the other barrels or chambers have 
been removed. 

•     Don't store a muzzleloader with powder in it. 

 Black powder is also used in some metallic cartridges for firearms 
specifically designed for their use. Care should be taken. Although they have the 

same name as a modern smokeless cartridge, they may not be interchangeable. 
Never interchange smokeless powder and black powder. Use them only in 
firearms intended for their use.

MODULE 13: RESTRICTED FIREARMS 
AMMUNITION 

13.0. Overview 

This module discusses handgun cartridges.  

  

 For more detailed information, consult a firearms dealer or a gunsmith. 
You can also consult the owner’s manual. 

13.1. Rifling 

a.  Most hand guns have a rifled barrel. Rifled barrels have a series of spiral grooves 

inside the barrel. The ridges of metal between the grooves are called lands. The 
lands and grooves together make up the rifling (Figure 91). 

b.  Rifling makes the bullet spin as it leaves the barrel so that it will be stable in 

flight. 

13.2. Calibre 

a.  Rifled firearms are sized by calibre. A calibre is a measurement of bore diameter 

in either thousands of an inch (Imperial) or in millimeters (Metric). Inch 
dimensions are usually measured from land to land, while metric dimensions are 
measured from groove to groove. 

 

 

 Always consult the data stamp on the barrel of your firearm to find out 
the exact name of the ammunition that fits it.

13.3. Cartridges 

13.3.0. Overview 

a.  A cartridge is the ammunition used in a firearm. Two kinds of cartridges 
commonly available are: rim-fire and centre-fire. These terms describe where the 

primer is located at the base of the cartridge casing. They also describe where 
the firing pin strikes. 

b.  Manufacturers produce firearms of many calibers. Always make sure that the 
cartridge name on the head stamp (Figure 92) matches the information on the 

data stamp, on the barrel or slide of the firearm (Figure 93), if available. This is 
the most important point to remember. Then choose the right type of ammunition 
for your firearm and target. The right shape or weight of the bullet is an example. 
If in doubt, consult a firearms or ammunition dealer. 

c.   If there is no data stamp, take the firearm to a qualified individual. They can 
measure the chamber and advise on proper ammunition. Additional information 

is available from manufacturer’s catalogues and brochures. 

d.  Many firearm owners load their own centre-fire ammunition. This allows them to 

save money and create a high quality product made specifically for their firearm 
and shooting conditions. 

e.  Incorrectly loaded ammunition may cause the firearm to malfunction or jam. 
Malfunctions could lead to an incident. The firearm could blow up and injure the 

shooter. Do not accept or use reloaded cartridges unless you know that they 
were made and reloaded correctly.

Figure 93. Example of a barrel data stamp 

 Some firearms may not have a data stamp, or they may have an incorrect 
stamp. Some firearms may have been altered and the existing data stamp may be 
incorrect. They should be checked by a qualified individual before use. If you are 
reloading your own ammunition, you must strictly follow the instructions and 

procedures outlined in the manuals provided for this process. Visually inspect all 
cartridge components for defects before loading.

13.3.1. Types of cartridges 

There are two basic types of modern cartridges: rim-fire and centre-fire. 

a.  Rim-fire ammunition’s priming chemical fills the space inside the bottom rim of a 

thin brass or copper cartridge casing. The soft rim dents when struck by the firing 
pin. This crushes the priming compound. It explodes, and ignites the powder 
(Figure 94). 

•     The .17hmr is also a rim fire ammunition but the popular-modern rim-fire 
cartridges are .22 calibre. They commonly come in short, long and long rifle. 

A .22-magnum cartridge is also available; however, it is not interchangeable 
with the other .22 cartridges. Be sure to use the correct ammunition for your 
specific firearm. 

•     Rim-fire cartridge bullets generally are made of lead. They can be jacketed or 
lubricated with grease or special waxes that reduce the build-up of lead in the 
handgun barrel except for the .17hmr that is jacketed 

 Dry firing a rim-fire firearm can damage the firearm. Dry firing means 
to initiate a firing sequence without a cartridge in the chamber.

MODULE 13 

241 

b.  Centre-fire ammunition is generally used for larger-more powerful calibre 
firearms. The primer is located at the centre of the base of the cartridge case. 

The firing pin strikes the primer. This explodes the priming compound. This in 
turn ignites the powder charge.

13.3.2. Cartridge names 

a.  There are various ways of identifying or “naming” cartridges. Some cartridges 
have several names. The cartridge name, or an abbreviation of it, is stamped on 

the head of the case. It is also found printed on the ammunition manufacturer’s 
box. 

 Cartridges with different names are not interchangeable (such as 
.38 S&W/.38 Special/.38 Super Auto) 

b.  Some manufacturer may choose to make a firearms or cartridge ammunition 
originally made by another manufacturer resulting in confusion. For example, you 

can use a Smith & Wesson handgun to fire a .357 Remington Magnum cartridge 
made by the Federal Cartridge Company. 

c.   The head stamp includes very valuable information, such as the cartridge name. 

It may also tell you the following: 

•     The calibre 

•     The manufacturer 

•     Whether the ammunition is regular or magnum and any other relevant details. 

d.  Always read the cartridge name. It is the only way to be sure that the cartridge 

matches the firearm. If in doubt, check with a gunsmith or gun shop. 

e.  The term magnum comes from the description of a large bottle of wine. It was 

first applied to large bottleneck cartridges that produced greater power than was 
the normal standard for that calibre. Today, it is more a marketing term than a 
technical term, but it is an important part of the name. 

f.   To choose the right ammunition for the type of target and firearm, follow the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. For handgun ammunition, the manufacturer’s 

recommendations are included in the catalogues distributed through sporting 
goods stores and gun shops.

13.3.3. Cartridge components and materials 

Ammunition varies in size, appearance and materials. Ammunition cartridges for 
handguns are made up four basic components described below (Figures 99 and 100): 

 

1.  The bullet is the projectile at the front end of the cartridge. It is propelled from the 
firearm by the expansion or explosion of gas from the burning powder. Usually, the 

bullet is made of lead, lead alloy or other dense material. It may also be covered by 
a jacket of a harder metal. When the nose of the bullet is covered in this manner, it 
may be referred to as a full metal-jacket, hard point or ball ammunition. If the lead is 
exposed at the front of the bullet, it is referred to as a jacketed soft point. Copper or 
gilding metal is commonly used as jacket materials. Bullets come in a variety of 

sizes, shapes and weights. You must select the right combination for the target that 
you plan to shoot. Target bullets are often made from lead alloy. Lead-handgun-
target bullets are commonly of a design known as a wadcutter or semi-wadcutter. 
Their sharp edges produce precise holes in paper targets. 

2.  The powder charge is a chemical compound inside the case. It is ignited to propel 

the bullet through the barrel. 

3.  The case holds all the other ammunition parts. It is usually made of brass. It could 

also be made of steel, copper or aluminum. 

4.  The primer contains a chemical mixture that explodes when the firing pin strikes it. 

This explosion ignites the powder charge.

13.4. Ballistics 

a.  Ballistics is the study of projectiles in flight and what affects them. 

b.  Modern firearms can shoot a long distance. For this reason, every shooter should 

understand ballistics. Handguns can shoot a bullet more than two kilometers. 

c.   Ballistics tables for ammunition supply the information to calculate the flight path 

and performance of cartridges. 

d.  You want to shoot safely. Therefore, you need to know how far your projectile will 

travel. That means that you need to know the dangerous range. 

 Be sure of your target and beyond. If there is any reason your shot may 
be unsafe, do not fire.

MODULE 13 

249 

13.5. Trajectory 

a.  The trajectory is the path a discharged shot or bullet takes during flight. Several 

factors affect this path; examples include, but are not limited to, the following: 
•     Gravity pulls the bullet down toward the ground as it is travelling forward. 

This results in a downward curved path. 

•     Air resistance slows down the flight of the bullet. 

•     Velocity is the speed at which a bullet travels in a given time and direction. 
•     Mass is the weight of the bullet. 

b.  The firearm muzzle must be raised from the horizontal position to make up for 
gravity. The trajectory of a projectile is curved. It crosses the line of sight twice on 

the way to a target. 

 

 

Figure 102. Trajectory of a bullet 

 Responsible shooters will follow the recommendations below: 

•     Shoot only at targets within effective range. 

•     Consider the maximum distance the shot or bullet may travel 

beyond the target. 

•     You are responsible for where the bullet stops.

13.6. Hazards 

The selection of the correct ammunition for the firearm is critical to safe operation but 
sometimes even the correct cartridge can fail to fire properly. Modern commercial 
ammunition is normally very reliable but there are several ways the cartridge may not 
fire. 

•     A misfire is a cartridge that does not fire. Misfired cartridges should not be reused in 

the firearm and must be disposed of properly. Muzzleloading firearms may also 
misfire. 

•      A hangfire is a delayed fire in which the firing pin strikes the primer but it does not 
create enough flame to ignite the powder instantly. If the muzzle is not pointed in a 
safe direction when the cartridge eventually fires, it may result in an injury. If the 

cartridge is removed from the chamber and then discharges, the explosive rupture of 
the case may also cause injury. Muzzleloading firearms may also have a hangfire. 

•     A primer pop (squib load) happens when the cartridge does not contain any 
gunpowder or when the gun powder is no longer effective. The firearm will discharge 

the primer without the usual noise or recoil. This may have enough force to push the 
bullet out of the case, but the bullet may lodge in the barrel. If another bullet is fired, 
the barrel may rupture and cause possible injury. 

 If the trigger is pulled and there is no noticeable discharge, wait 60 
seconds while pointing the muzzle in a safe direction. If there is no hangfire 

within 60 seconds, open the action and unload the firearm. PROVE the firearm 
safe to ensure that are no bullets lodged in the barrel. 

 

13.7. Firearm malfunctions 

 Generally, using commercially made ammunition and a properly 
maintained firearm, malfunctions will not occur. Firearms jammed with a cartridge 

in the chamber(s) can be hazardous. This hazard, if not dealt with properly, may 
result in a serious injury. Consult a qualified person or gunsmith for information 
on how to perform this function in the safest possible manner with your particular 

firearm.

MODULE 13 

251 

13.8. Ammunition precautions and legislation 

Explosives information is issued by Natural Resources Canada. It indicates that you 
may keep reasonable quantities of sporting ammunition on your property. “Reasonable” 
means quantities typically required for a rifle, handgun, shotgun or for part of a 
collection. This ammunition must be for your private use, not resale. Contact Natural 
Resources Canada for details. You must take every necessary precaution against 
incidents by adhering to the instructions below: 

•     Ammunition must be stored out of children’s reach. It must be kept away from 

flammables. 

•     Ammunition for a restricted firearm may only be stored in a place where it is not 
within easy access to the firearm, unless the ammunition is stored, together with or 

separately from the firearm in: 

o    A securely locked container or receptacle that cannot be easily broken open or 

into; or 

o    A securely locked vault, safe or room specifically built or adapted for the secure 

storage of restricted firearms. 

•     In a dwelling house, ammunition for a restricted firearm must not be displayed with 

the firearm and it cannot be within easy access to the firearm from which it can be 
discharged. 

•     In a place other than a dwelling house, ammunition for a restricted firearm must not 
be displayed with the firearm and it cannot be within easy access to the firearm from 

which it can be discharged, unless the ammunition is displayed in a securely locked 
container or receptacle that cannot be easily broken open or into. 

•     All ammunition should be stored in a cool, dry place, preferably in a vented 
container. This will reduce the chance of corrosion or breakdown of ammunition 

components that could cause the firearm to jam or misfire. 

 Keep in mind that storing ammunition in an unvented container may 
create an explosive hazard during a fire.

Ammunition Safety Points to Remember 

•     Carry ammunition only for the firearm you are using. 

•     Never experiment with unfamiliar ammunition. 

•     Using modern ammunition in old firearms may be hazardous. 

•     When a misfire occurs, slowly count to 60 while pointing the muzzle in 

a safe direction. Remove the cartridge following safe procedures. 
Then, carefully inspect the bore for obstructions. 

•     Never use old or corroded ammunition or reloading components. 

•     Never use cartridges if you are not certain about their safe use. 

•     Never interchange smokeless powder and black powder. Use them 

only in firearms intended for their use. 

•     Store all ammunition so that unauthorized persons do not have access 

to it. 

•     Never display a firearm with its ammunitions. 

•     Ammunition is most safely carried in its original container. 

•     When hand loading your own ammunition, be certain to strictly follow 

the procedures in the manuals about reloading ammunition. Treat 
primers with extra caution— they are explosive devices.

ACTIONS 

14.0. Overview 

a.  To understand the safe use of firearms, you must become familiar with action 

types, how they work, and how to safely load and unload them. 

b.  This module first defines the different types of firearms, various safeties and 

action releases and shows how to do the following: 

•     Identify each type of action; 

•     Locate safeties (some actions will not open unless the safety is OFF); 

•     Open actions and unload— ACTS and PROVE It Safe; and 

•     Safely load each type of action, with the safety ON, whenever possible. 

 Always wear safety glasses and hearing protection when loading and 
discharging firearms.

14.1. Common types of handgun actions 

Handguns are generally classified by their type of action. There are two basic types as 
follows: 

a.  A revolving action is used for some handguns. It has several chambers in a 
rotating cylinder and can contain one cartridge in each chamber. Revolvers are 

manufactured as a non-swing cylinder, a swing-out cylinder or a top break. 

 

Figure 103. Revolver 

b.  A semi-automatic action extracts and ejects empty casings and inserts another 

cartridge in the chamber automatically after each pull of the trigger.

 - 256 - 

MODULE 14 

257 

14.2. Other types of handgun actions 

a.  A hinge (or break) action opens near the breech and is usually single or double 

barreled. 

 

Figure 105. Break-action revolver 

b.  A bolt action is similar to a door bolt and can be either single shot or multiple 

shot. 

14.3. Trigger functions 

There are three primary functions. They are single action, double action and double 
action only. 

a.  A single action is an action that releases the hammer from a cocked position 

when the trigger is pulled. 

 

Figure 106. Single-action handguns 

b.  A double action is an action that cocks and fires with a complete pull of the 

trigger. Double actions may also fire in single action mode. 
 - 257 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

258 

 

Figure 107. Double-action handguns 

c.   A double action only is an action that cannot fire in the single action mode. 

 

 Double action/single action requires a different trigger pull between the 
first and subsequent shot. 

 

14.4. Safeties 

14.4.0. Overview 

a.  A mechanical device known as a safety is included on most firearms to reduce 
the chances of unintentional firing. However, mechanical devices can fail. A hard 

blow may cause some firearms to fire even with the safety ON. Therefore, safe 
handling of a firearm by the person holding it will always be the most important 
firearm safety device. Always use the safety, but never rely on it to prevent firing. 

b.  The safety is designed to prevent the firearm from firing by interrupting the firing 

sequence. The safety blocks one or more of the trigger, sear, hammer or firing 
pin. 
 - 258 - 

MODULE 14 

259 

c.   There are two types of safeties: manual safeties and built-in safety devices. 
Manual safeties can be placed on or off. They include slide safeties, like the lever 

safety, and frame safeties, like the safety lock. Built-in safety devices may 
prevent unintentional discharge. They include decocking levers, trigger safeties, 
magazine disconnects and grip safeties. 

 Never rely on a safety to prevent unintentional firing. A safety can fail. 
All safeties are slightly different. Consult the owner’s manual. Different 
manufacturers may use different terminology to describe their safeties. 

14.4.1. Manual safeties 

a.  The lever safety is found on either the right or left side of the receiver. It is 

operated by pushing forward and back to either the ON or OFF position. 

b.  The safety lock is normally operated by pushing it up into a notch on the slide. 

These safeties are commonly found on the left side of the receiver, near the 
hammer on single-action semi-automatics. 

c.   With semi-automatic handguns, the hammer is automatically placed into the full-
cock position each time the slide is pulled to the rear. In single and double-action 

semi-automatic handguns, the hammer remains in this position. In double action 
only, the hammer returns forward to the rest position. Whenever possible, when 
operating the action of any firearm, always have the safety on. 

14.4.2. Built-in safeties 

 These safety devices may or may not be present on your firearm. Always 
consult your owner’s manual. 

a.  With a double-action semi-automatic handgun, there may be a decocking 
device or decocking lever. These are common on modern models. Instead of 

carefully manually decocking the hammer as you would with single-action 
revolvers and semi-automatics, you need only depress the decocking lever. The 
decocking lever safely lowers the hammer. To accomplish this task, hold the 
firearm firmly in the strong hand and depress the decocking lever with the weak 
hand thumb. On some handguns, the decocking lever also engages the safety. 
Double-action only handguns do not have a decocking lever. 

b.  The trigger safety is found on some models of handguns. This is a pivoting 
device found as a part of the trigger. As the trigger is pulled, the safety moves to 

the OFF position and the handgun can be fired. 
 - 259 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

260 

c.    The magazine disconnect safety prevents the firearm from being discharged, 

when the magazine is removed. 

d.  The grip safety is usually found on semi-automatic handguns. It disengages 

when the firearm is held in and ready to fire. 

e.  The hammer block/transfer bar will prevent the firing pin from touching the 

primer. On many older revolvers, the firing pin may rest on the primer of any 
cartridges directly below it when the hammer is in the forward position. If the 
hammer is struck, the cartridge will fire. Most modern revolvers include a safety 

device to prevent this from happening. This is normally accomplished by 
preventing the firing pin from touching the primer unless the trigger is held all the 
way to the rear. The most common safety devices used to accomplish this are 

the hammer block and transfer bar. Consult your owner’s manual or a 
gunsmith to find out if your revolver has one of these devices. 

 Be very careful when moving the hammer. It could slip from beneath 
your weak hand thumb and fire the cartridge. Persons who are right handed 
would consider their left hand as their weak hand. The presence of a half cock 
on a firearm does not guarantee it is a safety. Some firearms do not use it as a 
safety. Consult the owner’s manual. 

f.   Safely lowering the hammer from the full-cock position on a single-action revolver 

requires caution. The following method can be used when a “cease-fire” is called 
and the hammer is at full cock: 

1.  While maintaining a solid grip with the strong hand, place the weak-hand 

thumb fully on the hammer. 

2.  Pull the trigger with the strong-hand finger and begin to slowly lower the 

hammer fully forward.  When the hammer is disengaged, release the trigger.  

If a semi-cocked position exists on the firearm, the hammer will immediately 
stop. 

g.  There are some differences between various models of single-action handguns. 

If possible with the model you are using, move the trigger finger off the trigger 
and out of the trigger guard immediately after the hammer begins to move 
forward. Slowly and carefully, lower the hammer. If there is no half-cock position, 
lower the hammer all the way forward and down. 

h.  Double-action handguns also rely on a heavy-double-action trigger pull as a 

further safety barrier to unintentional firing. 
 - 260 - 

MODULE 14 

261 

 Before loading any firearm, determine the position of the safety. Although 
all the illustrations of revolvers and pistols in this manual depict firearms with 
exposed hammers, many manufacturer’s produce them with internal hammers. 
Although some of these internal hammers function identically to the external 
hammers on comparable pistols, most function more like the mechanism on a 

bolt action. The hammer does not pivot on an axis; it moves back and forth in a 
straight line. It is called a striker. Some striker mechanisms use a built-in firing 
pin; others hit the firing pin and drive it forward. All the safety procedures for 
exposed hammers apply to internal hammers, but because the hammer is not 
visible, it is difficult to see if the hammer is cocked. Great care should be taken. 

14.5. Action releases 

Most handguns, other than semi-automatics, have some type of mechanism that must 
be moved to allow an action to be opened or closed. The location of the action release 
mechanism depends on the make and model of the firearm. 

 

 Do not touch any firearm unless you know how to handle it safely. If you 
do not know, get consult the owner’s manual or consult a gunsmith who knows 
that firearm well.

14.6. General loading and unloading procedures 

Before attempting to unload a firearm, first follow the Vital Four ACTS of Firearm 
Safety and PROVE it safe. 

 

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 

•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards yourself 

or any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the trigger 
guard.

14.6.1. Unloading procedure: ACTS and PROVE It Safe 

PROVE is an acronym, or memory aid, that stands for the five steps required to ensure 
a firearm unloaded and is safe. The five steps are: Point, Remove, Observe, Verify and 
Examine. These procedures must be followed to safely unload any firearm. 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure. 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure. 
•     Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the unloading process. 

2.  Remove all ammunition as follows: 

•     If the firearm has a detachable magazine, remove the magazine from the firearm 

first (this prevents a semi-automatic from chambering another cartridge if the 
action closes). 

•     Open the action to remove any cartridges from the chamber(s). 
•     Leave the action open. 

3.  Observe the chamber(s) to confirm that there is no cartridge(s) or empty casing(s). 
4.  Verify that the feeding path is clear of ammunition, casings or foreign objects. 

5.  Examine the bore for lubricant, rust or other obstructions. 

The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of the person who 
unloaded and ACTS-PROVEd it safe. 

14.6.2. Checking the barrel for obstructions 

Always check the barrel and chamber for obstructions before loading. 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it, and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged.

14.6.3. Loading procedure 

1.  Prepare the firearm by going through the complete unloading procedure— ACTS 

and PROVE It Safe. 

2.  Clear any obstructions from the chamber(s) and bore(s). Clean if required. 

3.  Put the safety ON, if it can be left on during the loading process. 

4.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the loading and 

chambering procedure. 

5.  Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this process. 

6.  Where possible, with the action open, select and load the correct ammunition by 

matching the data stamp on the firearm to the head stamp on the cartridge. 

7.  Point down range, extend arm, locking wrist and elbow, and close the action. 

8.  Leave any safety on (if applicable) until ready to fire. 

The firearm is now loaded and ready for use. It requires continuous care and 
attention until it is unloaded. 

 Always be sure of your target and beyond. 

 

14.6.4. Loading and unloading the most common action 
types 

 Do not attempt to handle any firearm that you are uncomfortable 
handling. To ensure safe handling of any firearm, seek the assistance of a 

qualified individual.

14.7. Operating repeating firearms: revolver actions 

14.7.0. Overview 

a.  All firearms have their own unique aspects. One of the best ways to discover the 
specific methods for unloading and loading your particular firearm is to study the 
owner’s manual. The steps outlined in this module are not meant to replace a full 
understanding of a given firearm owner’s manual. The following information is an 
introduction to the most common actions. The general procedure does not 

change, but the details can vary significantly. 

b.  Many firearms are repeaters. Revolvers, for example, are repeaters because 

they hold more than one cartridge and can be fired several times in a row. The 
most common repeating handguns are the revolvers described in this module. 

c.   The extra cartridges in a manually repeating revolver are contained in the 

cylinder (Figure 108). 

d.  The revolving action takes its name from a revolving cylinder containing a 

number of cartridge chambers. One chamber at a time lines up with the barrel 
and hammer. Revolver cylinders may rotate either clockwise or counter-
clockwise, depending on the manufacturer. 

e.  Most single-action revolvers have cylinders that are incapable of swinging out. 

Cartridges are inserted and removed one at a time through a loading port, 
usually located on the right side. When firing the single-action revolver, the 
hammer must be manually placed in the full-cock position for each shot. Pulling 
the trigger completes one function. It releases the hammer.

14.7.1. Revolver: single-action non-swing-out cylinder 
(loading gate)/unloading procedure — ACTS and PROVE It 
Safe 

 Before attempting to unload a firearm, first follow the Vital Four ACTS of 
Firearm Safety - PROVE It Safe 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure. 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure. 

•     Open the loading gate and check if the cylinder will rotate. If the cylinder does 

NOT rotate, put the safety ON, hammer in half-cock/loading notch during the 
unloading procedure. 

2.  Remove all ammunition: 

When the cylinder rotates, observe each chamber through the loading port, as 
you turn the cylinder, to ensure that there are no cartridges in the cylinder. If any 
cartridges or casings are present, use the ejector rod under the barrel to remove 
them. The chamber must be aligned with the loading port. Push the ejector rod 
from the front to back. Let any cartridge or casing fall on the shooting bench or 
range floor and leave it there until you have completed all the steps. 

3.  Observe every chamber(s) to confirm that there is no cartridge(s) or empty 

casing(s). 

4.  Verify by inspecting to ensure that the feeding path is clear of ammunition, 

casings or foreign objects. 

5.  Examine the bore for lubricant, rust or other obstructions. 

The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of the 
person who unloaded and ACTS-PROVEd it safe.

 Before attempting to unload a firearm, first follow the Vital Four ACTS of 
Firearm Safety - PROVE It Safe. 

1.  Point the firearm in the safest available direction throughout the unloading 

procedure: 

•     Make sure that nothing touches the trigger throughout this procedure/ 

•     Put the safety ON, if applicable. While most revolvers do not have safeties, 

some do. Consult your owner’s manual or ask a qualified gunsmith. 
2.  Remove all ammunition as follows: 

•     Operate the cylinder release and expose the chambers by swinging the 

cylinder to the side or top. 

•     Tip the muzzle slightly upward in a safe direction and operate the ejector rod 

to allow the cartridges or empty casings to fall out. If not ejected, remove 

them by hand. Let any cartridge or casing fall on the shooting bench or range 
floor and leave it there until you have completed all the steps. 

•     Leave the action open. 

3.  Observe the chambers to confirm that there are no cartridges or empty casings.  

4.  Verify by inspecting to ensure that the feeding path is clear of ammunition,

MODULE 14 

273 

 In a double-action revolver, pulling the trigger all the way to the rear 
completes two functions: 

1.  Turns the cylinder so a cartridge lines up with the barrel under the hammer; and 
2.  Cocks and releases the hammer. 

 

The cylinder normally has a release that enables it to swing out. This allows more 
than one cartridge at a time to be inserted, or ejected from, the cylinder. 

 

14.7.4. Revolver: double-action break open/loading 
procedure — ACTS and PROVE It Safe 

 Only load a firearm when you intend to use it and only in an area where it 
can be safely and legally discharged. 

1.  Prepare the firearm for loading by going through the complete unloading

275 

14.8. Semi-automatic actions: pistols 

14.8.0. Overview 

a.  With each pull of the trigger, the semi-automatic action uses part of the energy of 

the expanding gas from the burning powder to extract the empty cartridge case 
and to chamber the next cartridge. There is no need to load another cartridge 
into the firing position. Each time a cartridge is fired, the empty case is ejected 
and another cartridge is placed into the chamber from the magazine. 

b.  Semi-automatic handguns are further divided into single action, double action 
and double action only. In double action (D/A) and single action (S/A), the 

hammer stays cocked after each shot is fired, though the trigger pull is shorter 
and may need less pressure once the first shot is discharged. In D/A only, the 
hammer returns to the forward position after each shot is fired. 

c.   Semi-automatic safeties vary considerably. Most are located near the hammer. 

Consult your owner’s manual or a qualified gunsmith.

o    Hold the handgun in the strong hand and point in a safe direction. Extend 

arm, locking wrist and elbow. 

o    Grip the rear of the slide with the weak hand. Ensure your hand does not 

cover the ejection port. 

o    Pull the slide quickly and completely to the rear. This will extract and eject 

any cartridge or casing from the chamber. 

o    Let any cartridge or casing fall on the shooting bench or range floor and 

leave it there until you have completed all the steps. 

•     Lock the slide to the rear, normally by inserting the slide lock into the slide 

stop notch, where possible (Figure 117).

Prior to July 1993, owners of large capacity cartridge magazines that were affected by 
the limit were able to retain them if they had been properly modified to comply with the 
law. 

Magazine-Size Limits 

Part 4 of the Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other 
Weapons, Components, and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, 
Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or 
Restricted, sets out the limits for the number of cartridges permitted 
for different types of magazines. 

For example, for semi-automatic handguns the legal magazine 
capacity maximum is 10 cartridges.

MODULE 15: FIRING TECHNIQUES AND 
PROCEDURES FOR HANDGUNS 

15.1. Personal safety protection 

15.1.0. Overview 

Like many active sports, shooting has the potential to cause personal injury. The careful 
shooter takes steps to avoid these injuries by wearing personal safety protection. 

15.1.1. Sight protection 

a.  There is a risk of eye injury in shooting without eye protection. This can come 
from ejected cartridge casings. It can also come from fragments and other debris 

ejected during firing. 

b.  To avoid these hazards, shooters should wear safety glasses made of impact- 

resistant glass or polycarbonate plastic with side shields (Figure 119). They also 
guard against firearm malfunctions or bullet fragments. 

 

Figure 119. Sight and hearing protection 
15.1.2. Hearing protection 

a.  Continued unprotected exposure to shooting noise will cause hearing loss. The 
noise level of a gunshot is similar to that of a jet engine taking off at close range. 

The need for hearing protection is obvious. 

b.  Several types of hearing protection are available. On the firing range, shooters 

should always wear headphone-type hearing protectors. These protectors 
provide reasonable sound protection. Earplugs are available in several types. 
Disposable earplugs are made of foam or wax, but they can only be used once. 

c.   There are also reusable earplugs made of rubber available in several sizes. They 

require care and cleaning after use. 
 - 286 - 

MODULE 15 

287 

d.  For maximum hearing protection, it is highly recommended that both earplugs 

and headphone-type hearing protectors be worn. 
15.1.3. Slips and falls 

a.  Slips and falls may occur when handling firearms. This can best be avoided by 

using common sense. 

b.  If you do fall, remember your first action should be to control the muzzle of the 

firearm. This will prevent injury from a discharge. The damage from a fall is 
probably less than the possible damage from an unintentional discharge. 

c.   Beware of cumbersome clothing. It can interfere with the safe handling of your 

firearm. 

 Occasionally, a hot, ejected cartridge casing may come in contact with 
unprotected skin. This can cause a shooter to flinch. The sudden movement 
could result in unsafe muzzle control or discharge. Therefore, button up the 
collar and sleeves of your shirt or blouse. This way, a hot cartridge casing 
cannot get inside. 

15.2. Introduction to marksmanship 

a.  Marksmanship is the ability to hit your mark or target. Good marksmanship is 

important for safe shooting. 

b.  Marksmanship depends on many factors including grip, shooting position, aim, 

trigger control, controlled breathing and follow-through. These points are 
discussed in the following pages. 

15.3. Shooting positions 

15.3.0. Overview 

a.  A firm grip gives you complete control of your handgun when it fires. Changing 

your grip will affect sight alignment and bullet placement on the target. 

b.  You can fire handguns either one-handed or two-handed and from several 

positions. Only the basic standing positions are described below. 
 - 287 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

288 

15.3.1. The two-handed grip 

A similar two-handed grip is used for both revolvers and semi-automatics. Point the 
muzzle down range with your finger off the trigger and out of the trigger guard, until the 
sights are on the target. Grip the firearm using about the same pressure as you would to 
hold a carpenter’s hammer. 

 

 

Figure 120. Two-handed grip for a revolver 

 Using an incorrect two-handed grip, the thumb of the weak hand may be 
behind the slide. While firing a semi-automatic handgun in this manner, your 
weak hand can be injured by the recoiling slide. When using the grip shown in 
Figure 120, be certain that your thumbs do not contact the slide and are 
positioned on the weak-hand side of the handgun. 

 
 - 288 - 

MODULE 15 

289 

15.3.2. The two-handed stance 

a.  Stand with your body facing the target squarely. Spread your feet about shoulder 

width apart with weight distributed evenly on both feet to give you solid balance. 
Keep your knees straight but not locked. 

b.  Stretch out both arms towards the target and lock your elbows. Keep your head 

up. Control your breathing.

15.3.3. The one-handed grip 

 Hold the firearm firmly when firing with one hand to avoid losing control. 

 

Point the muzzle in a safe direction with your finger off the trigger. Wrap your fingers 
around the grip of the firearm with your thumb resting above the tips of your fingers as 
shown in the diagram. Hold firmly but not too tightly, using about the same pressure as 
you would to hold a carpenter’s hammer.

15.3.4. The one-handed stance 

a.  Stand with your body turned approximately 45 degrees from the target. Spread 
your feet about shoulder-width apart with weight distributed evenly on both feet to 

give you solid balance. Keep your knees straight but not locked. 

b.  Keep the muzzle pointed down range and the barrel parallel to the ground. 

Stretch out your firing arm towards the target. Lock your elbow and wrist. Keep 
your head up. Control your breathing. 

c.   Assume a comfortable position for shooting.

15.4. Aiming handguns 

A simple technique to use to determine your master eye  

 

 

Figure 125. Determining your master eye 

a.  Use your master eye for sighting. It is the stronger of your two eyes and will focus 

more accurately. 

b.  To find out which is your master eye, create a triangle using both hands as 

illustrated in the figure above. With both eyes open, view an object in the 
distance from the centre of the triangle. With both eyes remaining open, and 
keeping the object within the triangle, close the left eye and then open the left 
eye. Then, close the right eye and then open the right eye. The master eye will 
keep the object in the centre of the triangle. Always try to aim with both eyes 
open as this gives a better view of the area surrounding the target. 

c.   You must also learn to correctly use your firearm’s sight if your aim is to be 
accurate. Open sights require you to physically line up both rear and front sights 

with the target. This process is called sight alignment. When you aim any sight at 
a target, a sight picture is created (Figure 126). 

d.  Scope and electronic sights do not require alignment (Figure 127). Scope sights 

also might have the advantage of magnifying your view of the target. 

e.  When preparing to aim through a scope or electronic red dot sight, do not look 

away from the target and then try to find the target again by looking through the 
scope. Instead, while steadily watching the target, raise the handgun correctly to 
the two-handed stance with arms fully extended. Point the firearm toward the 
target area until the sight comes up naturally between your eye and the target.

MODULE 16: FUNDAMENTALS OF 
SHOOTING WITH RESTRICTED FIREARMS 

16.1. Sight alignment/Sight picture 

You must learn to correctly use your firearm’s sights if your aim is to be accurate. Open 
sights require you to physically line up both rear and front sights with the target. This 
process is called sight alignment. When you aim any sight at a target a sight picture is 
created. 

 

16.2. Breathing as it relates to shot release 

a.  Holding one’s breath is not natural. It’s not possible to judge how much air is held 
for each shot release, since there is no gauge on the lungs. The shot must be 

released in the natural pause in the breathing cycle. 

b.  We breathe in, we breathe out. There is a natural pause at the bottom of each 

exhale. It is this natural pause (2.5 seconds) that the shot must be released in. In 
order to lengthen this natural pause, the shooter has to breathe in deep, force the 
breath out deeper than normal, breathe in deep again, this time let the breath out 
normally. The natural pause in the breathing cycle has just been increased to 

approximately 8.5 seconds. That is plenty of time to confirm sight picture and 
release the shot, if not, just repeat the process. Breathe in deep, force it out, 
breathe in deep again, let it out NATURALLY and squeeze the shot off. 

c.   Figure 128 has been in circulation for over forty years. Unfortunately, some 
people are misinterpreting it and are reverting to “holding your breath” which it is 

incorrect.

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

298 

 

Figure 128. Normal and controlled breathing cycle 

 

16.3. Trigger control 

a.  Trigger control is essential for accurate shooting. When the sights are aligned on 

the target, squeeze the trigger slowly and steadily. Avoid yanking or pulling. 
Anything other than a smooth squeeze will cause the firearm to move and send 
the shot off target. 

b.  Don’t anticipate the shot. 
16.4. Follow-through 

Means maintaining your sight picture and/or shooting position after discharging the 
firearm. If you do not follow-through, it is more likely that your shot will be off target.

16.5. Safety procedures at the range 

16.5.1. Range commands 

The following are examples of typical range commands: 
•     “The range is active.” 

•     “Cease-fire.” 

•     “The range is no longer active.” 

 

 Range commands and signals vary between shooting sports, ranges and 
jurisdictions. Be sure you are aware of and clearly understand the commands and 

signals used in your area. If you are unsure, ask the Range Officer or a local 
official before you go to the range (Appendix G: Visual Range Signals and 
Devices). 

 

 

16.5.2. Range safety rules 

 The Range Officer (RO) is ultimately responsible for the safety of all 
persons using the range. Commands of the RO must be followed by all shooters 

at all times. 

 

Every range has rules on safe behavior. These may vary but will normally include the 
standard ones shown below: 

•     Use hearing and sight protection. 

•     The muzzle must always be pointed down range. 

•     The action of any firearm must be open at all times except when actually shooting. 
•     Firearms must be handled, loaded and discharged ONLY at the firing line. 

•     No firearm is loaded until the command to load is given by the Range Officer. 
 - 299 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

300 

•     Fingers must be kept out of the trigger guard and off the trigger until the firearm is 

pointed down range. 

•     Upon the command “cease-fire”, all firing stops at once. Firearms are unloaded. 

Actions are opened. Firearms are laid on the mat or on the table. Their muzzles 
point in a safe direction down range. The shooter steps back from the firing line, 
behind the cease-fire line. 

•     The Range Officer will inspect each firearm before allowing anyone to go forward of 
the firing line. He will verify that all the actions are open and there is no ammunitions 

in the chambers or chargers. 

•     During a cease-fire, no one will handle firearms or ammunition or return to the firing 

line. At this point, wait for further range commands before any further activity. 
Persons not engaged in changing targets down range should stand well behind the 
cease-fire line (Figure 129). 

 In an emergency, anyone can call a cease-fire.

301 

 

Figure 129. Range layout with direct supervision 

 

 Direct control is defined as having the firearm within eyesight and/or 
within arm’s reach of the shooter. 

 

There are other rules we recommend you follow: 

•     Minors and guests, who do not have a valid Firearms Licence, must be under direct 

and immediate supervision while shooting. Consult with your range for any further 
restrictions 

•     Firearms should be checked by the RSO on the cease-fire. This is to be sure that all 

actions are opened and no cartridges are in the breech. 

•     Unloaded firearms not in use are to be placed on the bench or table with the action 

open or kept in a case. They must be moved with muzzle pointed in the safest 
available direction or cased at the firing line. 

•     Horseplay, careless handling of firearms or any other distraction is not allowed while 

shooting is in progress. 
 - 301 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

302 

•     Make sure you are using the correct ammunition for your firearm and as approved 

by the range. 

•     Never shoot at target holders or other range equipment. 

•     Do not discharge firearms outside of the approved range property or outside range 

use times. 

 

16.5.3. Range courtesy 

There are certain standards of range courtesy and shooters must follow them. Some of 
these standards are listed below: 

•     Rules and procedures vary between ranges. Check and obey local rules. There 

should be a safety briefing before starting. 

•     Sign in to the firing range upon arrival. 

•     Avoid interrupting or distracting others when they are shooting. 

•     Do not smoke on the firing line. 

•     Ask the owner’s or shooter’s permission before handling that person’s firearm or 

equipment. 

•     Leave enough space between you and others to ensure safety. 

•     If firing particularly smoky firearms, shoot from downwind of other shooters on the 

firing line. Black powder firearms are especially smoky. 

•     Do not fire on other people’s targets, targets not directly downrange from yourself, or 

any target that may disturb others. 

•     Those firing semi-automatic firearms should take a firing point where other people 

will not be disturbed by ejected casings. 

•     Rapid firing may disturb those sighting-in or doing deliberate target work. 

 With the approval of the RSO: 

1.  Pick up cartridge casings. Take down targets. 

2.  Put away any range-owned equipment you have used. For example, 

sandbags or bench rests. 

3.  Sign out when you leave the range.

MODULE 16 

303 

16.6. Targets 

16.6.1. Acceptable targets 

Before firing at any target, verify the target by asking yourself the following questions: 
•     Is the range active? 

•     Am I sure I am shooting at my target? 

•     Are the targets approved by the RSO? 

 

16.6.2. Unacceptable targets 

Below are examples of unacceptable targets: 

•     Any target which, when fired upon, may damage the range. These include signs and 

main target holder supports; 

•     Someone else’s target on the range; 

•     Any target which is not directly in front of your firing point at the firing line; 

•     Any target which, when fired upon, may disturb others. For example, discharging 

firearms outside of posted range use times; 

•     Any target or a material or shape that can cause ricochets such as target holder 

frames or concrete walkways; and 

•     Any target made of glass or other material that causes fragment hazards. 

 

 The handgun may only be discharged in a place where it is lawful to do 
so. In Canada, such places are approved by a CFO; one such place is an 
approved range. Hunting with a handgun is not permitted.

16.7. Firearm servicing 

 Ensure that all firearms are unloaded and PROVEd safe before attempting 
to clean. Refer to Module 14 on unloading procedures— ACTS and PROVE It Safe. 

a.  Always be sure your firearm is functioning properly. A firearm that does not work 

properly is an unsafe firearm. 

b.  This module on minor maintenance and servicing procedures for your firearm is 

included for general information only. Specific information on cleaning and 
servicing your firearm is available in your firearm owner’s manual, at a gun shop, 
or from a gunsmith. Incidents can occur if these procedures are not performed 
correctly. 

c.   Firearms are precision instruments. Even minor repairs should be made by 
qualified individuals. Unqualified persons should never try to repair or modify any 

firearm. 

d.  The average user should do basic cleaning and lubrication only. 

 

16.8. Firearm cleaning 

16.8.0. Overview 

a.  Information on cleaning firearms safely may be obtained from your firearm 
owner’s manual. If you do not have one, contact the manufacturer. Accidents can 

happen if the cleaning procedure is not performed correctly. 
b.  Two major threats to firearm safety are as follows: 

•     Rust caused by moisture and condensation; and 

•     Excessive build-up of residue or rust in the firearm. 

c.   Either may cause excessive pressure, damaging the barrel. This is why regular 

cleaning is recommended. 

d.  The barrel of a firearm should be cleaned after every use. This will protect its 

finish. It will also help keep it in good working order. For instructions on cleaning 
the rest of the firearm, consult your owner’s manual. 
 - 304 - 

MODULE 16 

305 

e.  Modern smokeless primers and powders are non-corrosive. However, some 
older military surplus ammunition still contains corrosive chemicals. If you use 

corrosive ammunition, you should clean your firearm immediately after you use it. 
f.   Any firearm that has been stored for a long time must be cleaned thoroughly 

before use. Cleaning before using is required when the firearm has been 
exposed to moisture or dirt. 

 If cleaning your firearm requires disassembly, consult your owner’s 
manual. If disassembly is required to clean a firearm, always wear safety glasses. 

Residue or rust in the chamber or barrel may cause serious pressure build-up. 
Also, oil may mix with unburned powder and other residue may cause the firearm 
to jam. 

16.8.1. Cleaning materials 

a.  To clean a firearm properly, you need the following materials: 

•     a cleaning rod and attachments (be sure to use the right size for the firearm), 

such as a bore brush 

•     tips to hold cloth patches 

•     patches 

•     solvent (also called “bore cleaner”) 
•     gun oil 

•     a soft cloth 

b.  If possible, clean your firearm from the breech toward the muzzle. Avoid cleaning 

from the muzzle toward the breech. 

c.   However, you may have to clean some types from the muzzle end. In this case, 

lock the breech open. This permits the passage of the cleaning rod completely 
through the barrel. You will find a pull-through cleaning device helpful. Avoid 
rubbing the cleaning rod on the muzzle. Damage to the crown at the muzzle may 
occur. It is beneficial to insert a cloth into the open action to collect residue, to 
prevent dirt from entering the action, and to prevent damage to the firearm. 

d.  When cleaning a bolt action, remove the bolt, if possible. Clean the firearm from 
the breech end. Some firearms are easier to clean if you remove the barrel first. 
 - 305 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

306 

 While cleaning a firearm, remember and follow the Vital Four ACTS. 
These additional recommended practices for home safety with firearms might 

prevent accidents: 

•     Make sure no ammunition is nearby during cleaning. 

•     Never allow a loaded firearm in any building or living area. 

•     Always give cleaning your firearm your full attention. Never clean a firearm 

while doing something else, like watching television. 

 

16.8.2. General cleaning procedures 

1.  Attach the bore brush to the cleaning rod. Apply bore cleaner to the brush. 

2.  Run the brush through the bore of the barrel/chamber(s) several times. Be sure 

that the brush sticks out completely. Then draw it back through the barrel (Figure 
130). 

NOTE: When cleaning a revolver, always support the cylinder to avoid potential 
damage. 

3.  Remove the bore brush from the cleaning rod. Attach a patch-holder tip and a 
proper size cloth patch. Pour solvent on the cloth patch. Run through the bore of 

the barrel/chamber(s) several times. Remove the cloth patch from the rod tip. 

4.  Next, run a clean, dry patch through the bore/chamber(s) several times. 

5.  If the patch comes out dirty, repeat the first four steps. Do this until a patch finally 

comes through clean. 

6.  Next, run a lightly oiled patch through the bore/chamber(s). Use only light gun oil. 

7.  Wipe the outside of the firearm with a clean cloth and apply a light coat of gun oil 

or rust preventative to the metals surfaces. You should also maintain the 
condition of the stock by applying the appropriate wood treatment (consult the 
owner’s manual). 

8.   Always store your firearm lawfully in accordance with regulations. 

9.  Remember, before the next firing of the firearm, run a dry patch through the bore 

and the chamber(s) to remove any oil. 
10. Don’t forget to clean your magazine.

16.8.3. Cleaning ammunition 

a.  Ammunition should also be kept clean and dry. Oil, sand or dirt on the cartridge 

can damage the firearm. If could also cause jamming of the action. 

b.  Avoid exposing your ammunition to heat and vibration. Powder can decay and 

become unpredictable if exposed to excessive heat and long-term vibration. 

 
 - 308 - 

MODULE 16 

309 

 Primers are adversely affected by exposure to penetrating oils. Do not 
clean your ammunition with an oily rag. Before using any firearm, remove oil or 

grease from inside the barrel. Increased pressure caused by dirt or oil may cause 
the barrel to burst. This comes from the pressure generated in a dirty barrel when 
a bullet is fired through it. After storage and before you use the firearm again, run 
a clean patch through the bore. Remove all grease and oil. Always ensure your 

firearm is in good working order. Ensure that you have followed the Vital Four 
ACTS in order to PROVE the firearm safe before attempting to clean and 
throughout the entire cleaning procedure.

Below you will find brief descriptions of each class of firearms. For legal references, 
however, please refer to the Firearms Act and its Regulations, and Part III of the 
Criminal Code. 

 It must be noted that some rifles and shotguns are considered restricted 
or prohibited. Persons wishing to acquire such firearms should contact the 
Provincial or Territorial authorities or call the Canadian Firearms Program at 1-
800-731-4000. 

 

Restricted Firearms 

In general, individuals may possess restricted firearms for one or 
more of the following reasons: lawful profession or occupation, target 
practice or competition or as part of a gun collection.  The following 
are examples of restricted firearms: 

•     A handgun which is not a prohibited firearm; 

•     A firearm that is not a prohibited firearm, has a barrel less than 

470 mm (18½ inches) in length, and discharges centre-fire 
ammunition in a semi-automatic manner; 

•     A firearm that is designed or adapted to be fired when reduced to 

a length of less than 660 mm (26 inches) by folding, telescoping 
or otherwise; 

•     A firearm of any kind that is prescribed by regulation to be a 

restricted firearm.

Prohibited Firearms 

In general, individuals cannot acquire the types of firearms that fall 
into the prohibited class. Depending on the nature of their duties, 
employees of business and carriers, and public officers (police or 
peace officer, firearms officer, prescribed employee of a federal, 
provincial or municipal government) may possess prohibited 
firearms. The following are examples of prohibited firearms: 

•     Handguns  with  a  barrel  length  equal  to  or  less  than  105  mm 

(4⅛ inches); 

•     Handguns designed or adapted to discharge a 25- or 32-calibre 

cartridge (Any of the above-noted handguns are not prohibited 
firearms if they are used in competitions governed by the rules 
of  the  International  Shooting  Sport  Federation  and  prescribed 
by regulation.); 

•     “Sawed-off” rifles or “sawed-off” shotguns less than 660 mm (26 

inches) in length; 

•     “Sawed-off” rifles or “sawed-off” shotguns 660 mm (26 inches) 

or greater in length and have barrel lengths of less than 457 mm

barrel that is used in competitions governed by the 

rules of the International Shooting Sport Federation and 
prescribed by regulation) 

•      A device designed to muffle or stop the sound of a 

firearm (silencers) 

•     A cartridge magazine prescribed by regulation to be a 

prohibited device 

 

 Refer to the appropriate sections of the Firearms Acts and Regulations 
for detailed requirements relating to the storage, display, transportation and 
handling of restricted firearms. 
 - 314 - 

MODULE 17 

315 

 

a.  Remember, you are responsible for your firearms 24 hours a day. Anyone 
who owns or uses a firearm must meet safe storage, display, transportation and 

handling requirements. These requirements are set out in the Storage, Display, 
Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations. All of these 
are described in this module. 

b.  Firearms owners and users should always assume that anyone untrained in the 
safe handling and use of firearms does not know how to handle firearms safely. 
Incidents could occur from unauthorized access, especially where children are 

concerned. To prevent a tragedy, always store, display, transport and handle 
firearms and ammunition in accordance with the Regulations. 

c.   Remember the law requires that all restricted firearms can only be loaded 

and discharged in an approved or legal area. 
17.3. Storage 

A restricted firearm may be stored, only if it meets the following conditions: 
•     It is unloaded; and  

o    Rendered inoperable by using a secure locking device (Figure 132) and stored in 

a securely locked container (Figure 133), receptacle or room that cannot be 
easily broken open or into, or 

o    Stored in a securely locked vault (Figure 134), safe or room (Figure 135) 
specifically built or adapted for the secure storage of restricted firearms; and 

•     Not within easy access to ammunition, unless the ammunition is stored, together 

with or separately from the firearm in; 

o    a securely locked container or receptacle that cannot be easily broken open or 

into, or 

o    a securely locked vault, safe or room specifically built or adapted for the secure 

storage of restricted firearms.

17.5. Transportation 

a.  When transporting your restricted firearm between two or more specific places, 
you will need an “Authorization to Transport”. To obtain an “Authorization to 

Transport”, you need to contact a Chief Firearms Officer or call 1-800-731-4000. 
You will need to provide the following information: your firearms licence number, 
the registration certificate number of the firearm(s) to be transported, the 

frequency, dates and times the firearm(s) will be transported, the place of 
departure and destination of the transported firearms, and the reason for 
transporting the firearm(s).  

 Please note: provincial/territorial policies may also apply. 

b.  A restricted firearm may be transported only under the following conditions: 

•     It is unloaded; and 

o    Rendered inoperable by using a secure locking device; and 

o    In a locked container that is made of an opaque material and cannot be 
easily broken open or into or accidentally opened during transportation. A 

heavy-duty soft case (i.e. made of nylon) meets these requirements as 
long as you can lock it securely. 

•     You may leave the locked container (carrying the restricted firearm) in an 

unattended vehicle’s securely locked trunk or similar compartment. 

•     If the unattended vehicle does not have a securely locked trunk or similar 

compartment, lock the vehicle, or the part of the vehicle that contains the 
container, and leave the locked container out of sight. 

 IMPORTANT: Removing the firing pin or any other component of a 
restricted or prohibited handgun does not make that firearm legally disabled for 

transport. 

 

If you want to transport firearms on an aircraft, you should first contact the air 
carrier. The air carrier will provide information on its regulations and 
requirements.

17.6. Handling 

a.  Before obtaining a restricted firearm, think about how you will transport it home. 

The law requires that all restricted firearms be transported unloaded and 
rendered inoperable with a secure locking device. They must also be in a locked 
opaque case or container (Figure 137). 

b.  There are locations where discharging a firearm violates federal or provincial acts 

and regulations, or municipal bylaws. It may also be an offence to load or handle 
firearms in these places. You may load a firearm or handle a loaded firearm only 
in a place where it is lawful to discharge it. 

 A restricted firearm may only be loaded and discharged in a place where 
it can be safely and legally discharged.

The Vital Four ACTS of Firearm Safety 

 

Assume every firearm is loaded. 

•     Regard any firearm as a potential danger. 

 

Control the muzzle direction at all times. 

•     Identify the safest available muzzle direction. 

•     Keep the firearm pointed in the safest available direction. 
•     The muzzle of a firearm should not be pointed towards 

yourself or any other person. 

 

Trigger finger must be kept off the trigger and out of the 
trigger guard. 

•     Do NOT put your finger on the trigger or inside the trigger 

guard when you pick up a firearm. 

 

See that the firearm is unloaded - PROVE it safe. 

•     Do not handle the firearm unless you can properly PROVE it 

safe. 

•     Check to see that both chamber and magazine are empty. Do 

this every time you handle a firearm, for any reason. 

•     Pass or accept only open and unloaded firearms. It is an 

essential rule to adopt. 

 
 - 324 - 

MODULE 17 

325 

 

PROVE It Safe 

 

Point the firearm in the safest available 
direction. 

 

Remove all ammunition. 

 

Observe the chamber. 

 

Verify the feeding path. 

 

Examine the bore for obstructions. 

 

The firearm is now unloaded and safe until it leaves the direct control of the 
person who unloaded and PROVEd it safe. 

 Direct control is defined as having the firearm within eyesight and/or 
arm’s reach of the shooter. Only load a firearm when you intend to use it, and 

only in an area where it can be safely and legally discharged.

Appendix F: Reporting lost or stolen firearms, 
licences, etc. 

Where a firearm or other weapon is lost or stolen, or a licence, registration certificate or 
authorization is lost or stolen— it must be reported.  

A person commits an offence if after having lost a firearm, a prohibited weapon, a 
restricted weapon, a prohibited device, any prohibited ammunition, an authorization, a 
licence or a registration certificate, or having had it stolen, does not report the loss or 
theft with reasonable dispatch to a peace officer, firearms officer, or Chief Firearms 
Officer. 

Similarly, a person commits an offence, if on finding a firearm, a prohibited weapon, a 
restricted weapon, a prohibited device, or any prohibited ammunition, does not report 

the find, or deliver the item, with reasonable dispatch to a peace officer, firearms officer, 
or Chief Firearms Officer. This offence does not extend to documents, specifically an 
authorization, a licence or a registration certificate. 

Commission of either offence is punishable on summary conviction or by indictment.

Appendix G: Visual range signals and devices 

Flags or Signs: Typically a red flag flown at or near the entrance to the property. It 
serves to warn people that live fire may occur at any time and that shooters are actively 
using one or more ranges. Some clubs have individual "in use" flags for each range. 

 

Down Range Activity Signals: Typically a red light, rope, or red flag at the entrance to 
the down range area. Red means stop! Do not go down range. A few clubs use a green 
flag or light to indicate it is safe to go down range. This display should NOT be visible 

from the shooting positions! Some ranges fly "down range" red flags to show it is NOT 
safe to discharge firearms; this is potentially confusing unless the flag cannot be 

seen by people in the down range area. 

 

Shooting Line Activity Signals: Typically a red light, a red flashing light, a red flag, or 

a baffle clearly visible to the shooter when in the shooting position. Red means stop 
shooting! On some indoor ranges, the white lights that illuminate the firing line are 
dimmed and red illumination supplied. This display should NOT be positioned or used in 
a manner to be confused with the red signal at the entry to the down range area. Some 
ranges fly "down range" green flags to show that the range is safe for live fire; this is 
potentially confusing unless the flag cannot be seen by people in the down range area.

Appendix H: Gun collector 

The Firearms Act recognizes that collecting firearms is a legitimate reason for owning 
firearms. The rules on gun collecting apply to restricted firearms and to "grandfathered" 
prohibited handguns with barrel lengths of 105 mm or less, or 25 and 32 calibre. In 

order to collect grandfathered handguns, an individual must have registered one such 
handgun as of December 1, 1998 and then continuously thereafter maintained a 
registration for one such handgun. In order to qualify as a gun collector, a person must, 

•     have knowledge of the historical, technical or scientific characteristics of the firearms 

that are part of a collection; 

•     give signed consent to periodic inspections of the area where the collection is 

stored; and 

•     comply with safe storage, display, handling and transportation standards. 

When a person acquires a restricted firearm or prohibited handgun, or when he or she 
renews their firearms licence, the Chief Firearms Officer must determine whether the 
firearm is being acquired, or firearms already in possession are for the purpose of gun 
collection.

Appendix I: Firearms licences 

Under the Firearms Act anyone wishing to possess, borrow, buy, inherit or otherwise 
acquire firearms must have a valid firearms licence. 

The Firearms Act and firearms licences Regulations set out the following types of 
individual firearms licences: 

•     Possession Only Licence 

•     Possession and Acquisition Licence 

•     Minors Possession licence 

•     Non-resident Sixty-day Possession Licence (Borrowed Firearms) 

•     Non-resident Firearm Declaration (Confirmation of Importation of a Firearm by a 

Non-resident) 

Requirements for obtaining firearms licences are the same across Canada. Most, if not 

all of these licences are available on-line on the CFP website at: www.cfp-cpaf@rcmp-
grc.gc.ca. 

 

Possession Only Licence (POL) 

This type of licence authorizes the continued possession of firearms already owned, but 
does not permit the acquiring of additional firearms. This licence is no longer available 

to new licence applicants. Existing POL holders may renew their licence as long as they 
continue to lawfully and continuously possess at least one firearm in the particular class. 

Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) 

This type of licence is required for anyone wishing to acquire firearms, whether for the 
first time or in addition to the firearms already owned. An individual must successfully 
complete the Canadian Firearms Safety Course and/or tests to obtain this licence for 
non-restricted firearms. To obtain this licence for restricted firearms and/or prohibited 
firearms an individual must also successfully complete the Canadian Restricted 
Firearms Safety Course and/or tests. There is a minimum 28-day waiting period for this 
licence, unless the applicant already holds a valid POL, PAL or Minors Possession 
licence.

Appendix J: Transferring restricted firearms 

Sections 22 and 23 of the Firearms Act set out a number of conditions that must be 
satisfied by both parties involved in the transfer of a restricted firearm before the 
transfer is authorized. In addition, there are a number of conditions that apply in the 
Conditions of Transferring Firearms and Other Weapons Regulations.  

 

The following outlines the information that must be provided when individuals transfer 
(sell, barter, or give away) firearms. 

Transferor’s Obligations 

An individual who wants to transfer a firearm must: 

•     be reasonably sure that the transferee does not have a mental illness which would 

give rise to public safety concerns; 

•     be reasonably sure that the transferee is not impaired by alcohol or drugs; 

•     require the transferee to show a licence which authorizes the transferee to acquire 

and possess the particular class of firearm; 

•     be satisfied that the licence shown authorizes the transferee to acquire and possess 

the particular class of firearm; 

•     inform a Chief of Firearms Officer of the transfer and obtain his or her authorization; 

•     ensure that the following conditions (subsection 2(1) of the Conditions of 
Transferring Firearms and Other Weapons Regulations) are complied with; 

o    provide the Chief Firearms Officer with the transferor’s and transferee’s name 

and address; 

o    provide the Chief Firearms Officer with the transferor’s and transferee’s licence 

numbers; and 

o    inform the Chief Firearms Officer of the class of firearm being transferred. 

Transferee’s Obligations 

In order for a transfer to be authorized, the individual to whom the firearms will be 
transferred must: 

•     hold a possession and acquisition licence for the particular class of firearm; 
•     ensure that a new registration certificate is issued by the Registrar; 
 - 339 - 

STUDENT HANDBOOK – 2014 

340 

•     for the transfer of restricted firearms and prohibited handguns (pre-December 1, 

1998) only, 

o    inform the Chief Firearms Officer why he or she needs to acquire the firearms 

(lawful profession or occupation, target practice or competition, or part of a gun 
collection); 

o    if the transferee is acquiring the firearm to form part of a gun collection, he or she 

will have to provide the Chief Firearms Officer with: 

     information regarding his or her knowledge of characteristics which relate or 

distinguish the restricted firearms or handguns that he or she possesses; 
     signed consent to reasonably conducted periodic inspections of the area 

where the collection is kept; and 

    details of his or her knowledge of safe storage requirements for restricted 

firearms or prohibited handguns. 

•    for the transfer of prohibited firearms only, provide the Chief Firearms Officer with 

the number of the registration certificate issued to him or her. 

Before authorizing a transfer, the Chief Firearms Officer must determine whether or not 

the transfer will affect the safety of others. If the transfer is authorized, the Chief 
Firearms Officer will issue a unique transfer authorization number to both parties. 

Where transfers are completed by telephone, the transfer number provided to both 
parties will serve as a confirmation of the transfer and as a temporary registration 
certificate until a new registration certificate is sent in the mail. 

Effective January 1, 2003, registration information will have to be verified by an 
authorized verifier. The transferor will be asked to provide evidence that the information 
concerning the firearm has been verified by an authorized verifier. Verification has to be 
done only once and the registration certificate will indicate whether or not the firearm 
data has been verified.

the requirement for a transferor of a non-restricted firearm to wait for confirmation of the 
Transfer notification prior to releasing the non-restricted firearm to the transferee. The 
transferor must confirm the transferee is a holder of a valid PAL, with the proper 
privileges of acquisition, before transfer is finalized.  

 

Sections 22 and 23 of the Firearms Act set out a number of conditions that must be
